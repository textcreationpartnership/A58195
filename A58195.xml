            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Ourty years are now compleated, ſince firſt I began to be a Planter, and to dedicate more time than I could well have ſpared for diverſion, to that lovely recreation; and having by the help of a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diligence, collected all the rareſt Plants, Fruits, and Flowers, that by any means I could procure, either in this Nation, <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Flanders,</hi> at laſt by long acquaintance I learned their Qualities, and ſo by ſlow degrees attained to a conſiderable ſtock, both of Plants and Experience; and although I have little cauſe to commend the Ingenuity of my Neighbors, or the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Deſert where it was my unhappineſs to Plant them; yet with an unfainting perſeverance, I have continued my affection to this honeſt recreation, without Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Incouragement; and now in my Old age (wearied and weaned from other delights) find my ſelf more happy in this retired ſolitude, than in all the buſtles and buſie imployments of my paſſed days.</p>
            <p>Some years ſince, ſeriouſly conſidering Mr. <hi>Parkinſons</hi> Garden of pleaſant Flowers, and comparing my own Collections with what I there found, eaſily perceived his Book to want the addition of many noble things of new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſcovery, and that a multitude of thoſe there ſet out, were by Time grown ſtale, and for Unworthineſs turned out of every good Garden; the love of the Subject (more than any opinion I had of my own Abilities) ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded me to endeavor the ſupply of what was therein wanting, and by taking away the Worſe, to make room for Better; but after conſidering the whole Series and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the Book, I concluded with experienced Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb facs="tcp:50511:9"/>
that it were better to make uſe of ſome of the beſt materials, in the erecting of a New peice, than to repair and accommodate the Old; fitter to be faſhioned into the form of a <hi>Florilege,</hi> furniſhed with all requiſites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to a <hi>Floriſt,</hi> than continued in the old method of an <hi>Herbal,</hi> and inſtead of old names, uncertain places, and little or no virtues, to inſert ſome other things much more conſiderable.</p>
            <p>And now ingenious Reader, having told the occaſion, and by what ſteps I attained to this humble degree of knowledge, I ſhall proceed to acquaint you with what may be expected, either in Method, or Matter, from my performance.</p>
            <q>Bene docet, qui bene diſtinguit.</q>
            <p>In three Books therefore, as in ſo many Beds, have I lodged Earths Beauties, each Book having a peculiar Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and each Bed a Tutelar Deity.</p>
            <p>The firſt Book, under the Title of <hi>Flora,</hi> the Flowery Goddeſs, gives you ſeveral forms, and apt directions, how to make, plant, preſerve, and keep both Fruit and Flower-Gardens, furniſhed with the choiceſt Plants, Flowers, and Fruits, that will endure the extremity of our long Winters; deſcribing all ſuch as are not vulgarly known, with certain and aſſured directions how to ſet, make grow, increaſe, and preſerve each particular; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the raiſing of new Varieties; not taken out of ſimple Books (the Publiſhers and Retainers of many Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths) but learned from my own Practical expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Book carries the Title of <hi>Ceres,</hi> the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs of Seeds and Tillage, and ſhe preſents you with her Harveſt-Garland, made up with ſuch Plants and Flowers as are yearly, or every other year, raiſed from Seeds, with directions for the Sowing, tranſplanting, and diſpoſing each of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50511:9"/>The Third and laſt Book, intituled <hi>Pomona,</hi> invites you to a Banquet of the beſt Garden-Fruits our cold Northern Country will afford; acquaints you with their Names and Qualities, and how to Plant, Propagate and Improve them; as alſo what Vines are fitteſt for our Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; which are the beſt Berries; and brings you at laſt, to reſt in a Grove of ever-green Trees and flowering Shrubs, informing how to Plant, Order, and Diſpoſe them.</p>
            <p>As for the cutting the Figures of every Plant, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Wood, as Mr. <hi>Parkinſon</hi> hath done, I hold to be altogether needleſs; ſuch Artleſs things, being good for nothing, unleſs to raiſe the Price of the Book, ſerving neither for Ornament or Information, but rather to puzzle and affright the Spectators into an Averſion, than direct or invite their Affections; for did his Flowers appear no fairer on their ſtalks in the Garden, than they do on the leaves of his Book, few Ladies would be in love with them, much more than they are with his lovely Picture. I have therefore ſpared my ſelf and others ſuch unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Charge, and onely added ſome draughts for Flower-Gardens.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not attempt to celebrate ſo ſublime a ſubject as this in hand, ſince all the Flowers that are to be found in Rhetorick, hold no compariſon with thoſe of the Garden; neither will I throw away a word to ſtop the Mouth of malicious Ignorance, the Cenſures of ſuch commonly proving Praiſes; the Judicious better Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what they ſhall hear Condemned by ſo unworthy Judges.</p>
            <p>Certainly there are many, beſides my ſelf, that are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the alluring Charms of this lovely Recreation; to whom this Book may be Beneficial, and I wiſh as advantageous, as I now find ſuch a Work would have been to me, when firſt I began my Plantation; and if
<pb facs="tcp:50511:10"/>
theſe my humble Endeavours have the good fortune to find a friendly Acceptance, I ſhall think my time and travel well beſtowed; ſince to gratifie the Lovers of this delight, and to encreaſe their Number, is the higheſt ambition of</p>

               <hi>FLORA. THE FIRST BOOK.</hi> Of the making and planting of Fruit and Flower-gardens, with a Nurcery for Fruits and Flowers to furniſh both.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Air Houſes are more frequent than fine Gardens; the firſt effected by Artificers onely, the later requiring more skill in the Owner: few Gardens being found well furniſhed out of the hands of an affectionate Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. The love of ſuch a Maſter will keep each tender Plant alive, his care and skill hath collected: for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any Art or Excellence liked or loved by the Ignorant; it is Knowledge that begets Affection, and Affection increaſeth Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Love was the Inventer, and is ſtill the Maintainer, of every noble Science. It is chiefly that which hath made my Flowers and Trees to flouriſh, though planted in a barren Deſart, and hath brought me to the knowledge I now have in Plants and Planting: for indeed it is impoſsible for any man to have any conſiderable Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of noble Plants to proſper, unleſs he love them: for neither the goodneſs of the Soil, nor the advantage of the Situation, will do it, without the Maſters affection: it is that which animates, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them ſtrong and vigorous; without which they will languiſh and decay through neglect, and ſoon ceaſe to do him ſervice.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen many Gardens of the new model, in the hands of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful perſons, with good Walls, Walks and Graſs-plots; but in the moſt eſſential adornments ſo deficient, that a green Medow is a more delightful object: there Nature alone, without the aid of Art, ſpreads her verdant Carpets, ſpontaneouſly imbroydered with many pretty Plants and pleaſing Flowers, far more inviting than ſuch an immured Nothing. And as noble Fountains, Grottoes, Statues, &amp;c. are excellent ornaments and marks of Magnificence; ſo all ſuch dead works in Gardens, ill done, are little better than blocks in the way to interrupt the ſight, but not at all to ſatisfie the underſtanding.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50511:14"/>
A choice Collection of living Beauties, rare Plants, Flowers and Fruits, are indeed the wealth, glory and delight of a Garden, and the moſt abſolute indications of the Owners ingenuity; whoſe skill and care is chiefly required in their Choice, Culture, and Poſition.</p>
            <p>I have known many Perſons of Fortune pretend much affection to Flowers, but very unwilling to part with any thing to purchaſe them; yet if obtained by begging, or perhaps by ſtealing, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give them entertainment: An Unworthineſs more unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Rich, than puniſhable in ſuch Poor as ſteal through want. And perhaps to ſome he may ſeem no wiſer, that parts with forty or fifty pounds for an Horſe or Hawk, which muſt be daily fed and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, than he that gives ſo many ſhillings for a noble Plant or beautiful Flower, that needs little of either. But our faces are not more variable than our affections; and, I fear, that to Flowers is too innocent for this Age (guilty of ſo much wickedneſs) to take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in. Yet ſince our long Winter is ſo well over, and our illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous late-obſcured Luminaries have now regained their former ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, I ſhall adventure to bring forth my Plants and Flowers into the open air: but before I unveil their beauties, or diſcover their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, it will be neceſſary to prepare their lodgings, places to plant them. Thus much by the way as we paſs to the Garden.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to inform all ſuch as deſire to be Floriſts, how they may do as I have done, make their own Gardens themſelves, aſsiſted onely by ordinary Labourers: in which undertaking it is not my intention to intrude upon the Gardeners trade, nor to amuſe the Readers with Romantick Inventions; but (as a Floriſt) to acquaint the unskilful with ſuch Rules and apt Forms, as may be fit for the planting and diſpoſing of the beſt Flowers; and in ſo plain and eaſie a method, that every perſon of any capacity may be enabled thereby to be his own Gardener, obſerving that which followeth.</p>
            <p>To the Habitation of every Gentleman, or Perſon of conſiderable Fortune and Ingenuity, there ſhould belong two ſeveral Gardens joyned together, and onely divided with a Wall, ſo as there may be a paſſage out of the one into the other; and both of theſe for delight, recreation, and entertainment. As for the <hi>Kitchen-garden,</hi> a place more remote will be requiſite, ſerving onely for the publick uſe of the Family: but theſe two Gardens of delight would be ſeated on the South ſide of the Houſe, in reſpect of proſpect from the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and the benefit of Sun, and Shelter, which many tender Plants, Fruits and Flowers do neceſſarily require. Some to abate the rigour of the North and Eaſt winds, plant Pear-trees, Elms, or Sicamores, in default of Buildings, at convenient diſtance without the walls; which may be conſidered upon ſight of the place; for Situations are ſo various, that no poſitive Rules can poſsibly ſerve to fit all: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, every one abounds with his own reaſon, and may adde or alter as the place and his purpoſe ſhall require.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50511:14"/>The moſt graceful grounds for theſe Gardens, is an intire level; and the beſt Soil, is that, which is neither Clay nor Sand, but parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of both: and if either, it may be much helped by Compoſt. Hanging grounds, uncapable to be caſt into a Level, ſeldome make handſom Gardens: ſuch muſt be divided into parts, with Deſcents, as the convenience of the place will afford; in the deſigning and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, I ſhall adviſe all ſuch as are unexpert in ſuch operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be guided by ſome honeſt, and skilful Gardener, or other experienced perſon, upon whoſe judgement they may relie, and not truſt to the dilates of a green fancy, leſt they imploy their pains to purchaſe repentance, as I know many have done.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe Gardens of Delight, we will call the <hi>Fruit-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> the other the <hi>Flower-garden,</hi> which would be leſſer, and placed immediately under the walls of the houſe; the other on the Eaſt or Weſt ſide thereof, according to the quality of the place. I ſhall not adviſe any, to make either of theſe Gardens too big, for ſuch are commonly ill furniſhed, and worſe kept. Fourſcore yards ſquare for the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and Thirty for the <hi>Flower-garden</hi> will be enough for a Noble-man: but for a private Gentleman, Forty for the one, and Twenty for the other will be ſufficient; and ſo bigger or leſſer, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the draught you make choice of, or the fortune and fancy of the owner.</p>
            <p>If you are to incloſe a new ground for a Garden, be careful in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Walls, that the ſize, ſituation and form, may all be anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to your intended plot: the ground exactly meaſured, and tried, that the Walls may be neither out of ſquare or level, which will much advantage the work which is to follow. For the Foundation and a foot higher, Stone may ſerve, but after Brick is beſt; raiſing them nine foot high at the leaſt, on the inſide the Garden, and ſcued only on the outſide; and for dividing the <hi>Fruit</hi> from the <hi>Flower-garden,</hi> a thin wall of five or ſix foot high may ſerve; or elſe half Pales, cut with handſom heads, and put into a Brick colour, with equal porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of red Lead and Ochre, ground on a Painters ſtone with Linſeed Oyl, ſerving fitly for the planting of fine Roſes, on either ſide. The walls being finiſhed, the ground is to be prepared for planting: and firſt we will begin with the <hi>Fruit-garden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt place you are to divide the Walls for Trees: allowing about twelve foot in large Gardens betwixt them, and half the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at the corners: in leſſer Gardens ten foot or thereabouts, more or leſs, according to the ſpreading of the trees you intend to plant. Mark the places where they are to be ſet, then trench the Borders round about the walls a yard wide, and about two foot deep; but about the places marked for trees, two yards ſquare, that their roots may have room to ſpread, caſting therein good ſtore of old, well-rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Neats dung, which will laſt much longer than that of Horſes; and let it be all over about a foot thick, well mingled with good
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50511:15"/>
Earth, and troden down: then lay thereon another courſe of Earth mixed with Dung, and therewith raiſe the Borders to the height de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired: then mark and ſtake out the form of the whole Garden, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the deſign or draught you ſhall fancy; ſo that you may know the places where the Beds and Borders will be; the which muſt be trenched, and dunged as the former: but before you begin to ſet out any part of the Garden, the whole muſt be well digged, and caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a level, from ſide to ſide.</p>
            <p>The ground thus prepared, and having provided ſawed Rails, five inches broad, and an inch and quarter thick, that have been laid ſtraight, and ſeaſoned a year at the leaſt, let them be lined on the upper edge, gaged to a thickneſs, ſmoothed with a Plain, on that edge, and outer ſide, fitted to lengths, and pieced according to the Timber, and order of the work: you may put them into a Stone-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, with white Lead, common Ceruſe, or London white, ſome Charcoal, and Linſeed oyl ground together on a Painters ſtone: but the Rails, and the Stone-colour will laſt much longer, if they be firſt well primed with red Lead and Umber ground as the former: then after the Colours are drie, and the Rails fitted to their places, nail on the inſides thereof, pieces of hard wood that will laſt, about half a yard long, placing them an inch under the upper edge: if you ſet them too thin, the Rails will be apt to warp, and turn with the Sun: which done with diſcretion, make holes to let theſe feet into the ground, and ſo place them by a line, and a long level, that the upper edges may all be of one entire level, throughout the whole work, beginning with the Borders about the walls, and ſo place all the reſt in order, accordingly as the draught ſhall direct you: let the feet be well ramm'd, and the rails kept ſtraight and level, raiſed up, that they may be four inches on the outer ſide above the ground, after the Allies are gravelled and made: then fill every Bed and Border with good ſcreened or ſifted earth, and leave them like a ridge, higher than the Rails in the middle.</p>
            <p>The next work, is to prepare the places intended for Graſs, and to provide Turfs for them. Firſt, level the ground, and conſider the thickneſs of the Turfs, which when layed, muſt be three inches low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the upper edge of the Rails, and the Allies four inches, ſo the Graſs will be an inch higher, remembring ſtill from the Rails to fetch your meaſures, and level, to keep the whole work in order; and if the ground under the Turfs be not barren of it ſelf, it ſhould be covered ſome thickneſs with hungry Sand to make it ſo, that the graſs grow not too rank. The beſt Turfs for this purpoſe are had in the moſt hungry Common, and where the graſs is thick and ſhort, prick down a line eight or ten foot long, and with a Spade cut the Turfs thereby, then ſhift the line a foot or fifteen inches further, and ſo proceed untill you have cut ſo far as you deſire, then croſs the line to the ſame breadth, that the Turfs may be ſquare, and cut them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: then with a ſtraight bitted Spade, or Turving-Iron (which many for that purpoſe provide) and a ſhort cord tied to it near the Bit, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50511:15"/>
the other end to the midle of a ſtrong ſtaff, whereby one thruſting the Spade forward under the Turfs, and another by the ſtaff pulling backward, they will eaſily be flaied and taken up, but not too many at a time for drying, but as they are laid; which muſt be done by a line, and a long level, placing them cloſe together, and beating them down with a Mallet: having covered the quarter, or place intended, let it be well watered, and beaten all over with a heavy broad Beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Laſtly, cut away by a line what is ſuperfluous, that the ſides may be ſtraight and eaven, or in what work you ſhall pleaſe to fancy.</p>
            <p>The Graſs-plots being finiſhed, you may proceed to gravel the Walks and Allies. There are ſeveral kinds of Gravel, the Cat-brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed binding gravel is the beſt, and the looſe Sandy gravel the worſt; lay it ſomething thick, and beat down every courſe, the worſer in the bottom, and fine ſcreened gravel on the top, and in finiſhing, leave the Walks a little round in the middle; for the level, the Rails on either ſide will direct you that you cannot erre, remembring to lay the Walks and Allies four inches under the edge of the rails: theſe Walks and Graſs-plots muſt be often rolled with a weighty ſtone rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to keep them ſmooth and in good order. And now this Garden is ready to be planted with Trees, Shrubs and Flowers, each thing in its proper ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>The beſt time for planting Trees and Shrubs is in <hi>October,</hi> and then either of your own proviſion, or out of the Nurceries about <hi>London,</hi> you may furniſh the walls with <hi>Pears, Plums, Cherries, Apricocks, Peaches, Nectorins</hi> and <hi>Vines,</hi> making choice out of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona</hi>'s ſtore of ſuch you deſire; where you will find what Fruits are fitteſt for Walls, and what for Standards; which may be diſpoſed and ſet in the Garden at proportionable diſtances: betwixt which may be placed <hi>Roſes, Currans, Goosberries, Cypreſs-trees, Miſzerions,</hi> or what other Shrubs or Greens you like. The Borders about the walls and the reſt of the Beds may be furniſhed with the more ordinary ſorts of Flowers, as <hi>Lilies, Martagons, Pionies, Daffodils, Tulips,</hi> and ſo of all other ſorts, ſuch of each kind as are leaſt worthy to be received into the <hi>Flower-garden,</hi> where I would have all things rare. As for the placing, planting and ordering of all the Plants, Fruits and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, wherewith this or the <hi>Flower-garden</hi> is to be furniſhed, it is needleſs to be here expreſſed, for that at the end of every Chapter, where each particular is treated of, you will find ample direction for the doing thereof.</p>
            <p>In default of Timber to make Rails of the thickneſs forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Inch-boards ſlit to the breadth may ſerve; and ſome make uſe of Tiles or Bricks moulded on purpoſe, but both theſe are apt to break with the Froſts, and to be out of order. Some are at the charge to ſet their Gardens with Free-ſtone, hewed for the purpoſe, which ſtanding in the ground (unleſs it be very good) will moulder away, and cleave with the Winter-froſts. Next to the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Rails, <hi>Box</hi> well ſet is the beſt to border large Beds in a <hi>Fruit-garden,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50511:16"/>
and ſuits very well with <hi>Graſs,</hi> and may fitly ſerve for all but the Borders to the Walls, which would be kept up with Rails.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Palliſado's</hi> (or, as we uſually call them, <hi>Pole-hedges</hi>) are much in faſhion in <hi>France,</hi> and there ſet with dwarf Fruit-trees; ſuch are troubleſom to keep in order, and ſubject to ſtrong Winds, fit onely for ſpacious Gardens: but the beſt hedges for our Countrey are thoſe ſet with <hi>Pyracantha</hi> and <hi>Phyllirea;</hi> and for lower in leſſer Gardens, <hi>Celaſtrus</hi> and <hi>Alaternus;</hi> theſe will be alternately green, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond exceeding well with <hi>Box</hi> and <hi>Graſs:</hi> theſe Hedges muſt be kept narrow, and ſupported with ſtakes, rods or laths on either ſide, and as they grow, cut ſtraight by a line on the top, and even on the ſides. How to raiſe theſe Plants, and when to ſet them, you may find directed in the places where they are deſcribed.</p>
            <p>And now having done with the <hi>Fruit-garden,</hi> and made it a fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory for Fruits, Plants and Flowers of the more common kinds; we will proceed to the <hi>Flower-garden,</hi> and faſhion it in the form of a Cabinet, with ſeveral boxes fit to receive, and ſecurely to keep, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures choiceſt jewels.</p>
            <p>Having made choice of a Plot that for meaſure may fit the place, and ſtand provided of Rails four inches broad, and an inch and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thick, that have been well piled, kept ſtraight, and ſeaſoned, you muſt make uſe of ſome underſtanding Joyner to work them; firſt he muſt be made acquainted with the Draught, whereby he may know the length of every Piece from each corner and angle, (allowing for the joyning them together) and alſo the number of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in every length; which being cut out, muſt be lined, gaged and plained, as before is directed in the <hi>Fruit-garden;</hi> theſe only differing, in that they are to be moulded with an half Round on the outer edge. The Rails thus prepared, in the great Allies, near the place where they are to ſtand, may be joyn'd and faſt nail'd together at every corner and angle, and as the ſeveral Pieces are finiſhed, ſet on the ground (which muſt firſt be levell'd) in their proper places; and when all is finiſhed, ſet them exactly by a line, a long level, and a ſtanding meaſure, for the breadth of the inner Alleys, which muſt be as broad as the Beds. Every Piece, if they be of equal and true meaſure, perfectly ſquare at each corner and angle, will anſwer to the Line every way. When they are thus placed, and having prepared many pieces of hard wood, of half a yard long, and of a conſiderable bigneſs, that they may laſt the longer, let them into the ground on the inſide the Rails, an inch under the upper edge, and there nail and faſten them; the more of theſe feet you make uſe of, the faſter and better the work will ſtand, and not warp or turn with the heat of the Sun. Before the holes be filled, prime the Rails with Linſeed-oyl, Red-lead and Umber, well ground on a Painters ſtone, and after put them into a Stone-colour, with any of the forementioned Whites, Charcoal and Oil: as ſoon as the Colours are dry, place the Rails exactly, and try them every way with the line and level, filling and ramming the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50511:16"/>
feet hard, that they may not ſtir out of their places. The Borders about the Walls are to be of the ſame breadth and level with the Beds, and railed about on all ſides after the ſame manner. All which diligently performed, take the Earth out of every Bed and Border by degrees as you work them, about two foot deep, and lay the ſame in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, not ſtirring the Feet; then cover the bottoms all over with good old Neats dung, that it may be ſix inches thick, after it is hard trodden: next skreen the Earth, or ſift it through a Wier-riddel, and do the like by old Dung rotted to Earth, ſpread thin on the ground to dry, that it may the better paſs through the Skreen or Riddel, and fill the Beds and Borders therewith, putting in almoſt as much of the one as the other, more or leſs as the Earth is in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſtir up and mingle well together, and ſo proceed untill all be finiſhed. Laſtly, make the Alleys, thoſe within the Fret, raiſed with good binding Sand, laid ſmooth, and hard beaten, ſo that they may all lie level three inches under the upper edge of the Rails. For this Garden I deſign one of the Draughts of twenty three diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and each to be two foot ſix inches broad, then the Fret will be nineteen yards ſix inches ſquare; next thereunto an Alley of the ſame breadth round about, then a Border of the ſame breadth railed about as the Beds, broken about a yard and half wide for goings in, in the middle of every ſide, then cloſe up to the outer Rail, on the inſide put Poſts into the ground at each corner and end, with others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them equally divided; theſe Poſts muſt be of good ſawed Timber, of about five inches ſquare, and four foot high above the Rails; let them be well ramm'd, and of equal height, faſtening on the heads thereof Rails of the ſame breadth, unto which, and that at the foot, nail good well-prepared Laths ſloping, ſix inches aſunder, both ways chequer-wiſe, as every Joyner knows how: this Lattice-frame being well made, may be firſt primed white, and after colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed green in oil, with Pink and Verdigreefe, or Ortment and Indico. The Rail next to the Fret muſt be anſwerable thereunto, and the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der filled according to the reſt. All which performed, gravel the great Alley, and coat it with the ſame Sand, that it may be of the colour of the reſt.</p>
            <p>This inner Alley and Border will take up three yards and one foot, the Borders to the Walls one yard and two foot, the great Alleys five yards, two foot and ſix inches; to which nineteen yards and ſix inches (the meaſure of the Fret) being added, the whole Garden from wall to wall will be juſt thirty yards ſquare.</p>
            <p>And becauſe divers have Gardens already encloſed, that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the forementioned Fret will not fit, I have therefore deſigned Draughts of ſeveral ſizes, that every one may take that which beſt agrees with his ground, and is moſt proper for his purpoſe: the ſame Rules (before expreſſed) ſerving for all, onely altering the Meaſures for the breadth of the Beds and Alleys, obſerving the true diviſion, of which every Fret may be, what will beſt agree with the place from two foot to a yard. And thoſe that want Timber to make
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50511:17"/>
Rail's after the manner before directed, may ſet the Beds and Borders with <hi>French Box,</hi> and inſtead of the forementioned Lattice make a thin Pole-hedge with <hi>Celaſtrus, Alaturnus, Pyracantha</hi> and <hi>Phyllirea,</hi> or what of theſe he can get, which being ever green will agree very well with the <hi>Box:</hi> but the Borders to the Walls nevertheleſs muſt be ſupported with Rails, to keep them and the Walks divided and in good order.</p>
            <p>I know a Garden ſo ſet with <hi>Box</hi> will ſhew very well, and (if care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept) will laſt many years; but it will be three years before the <hi>Box</hi> be grown to perfection; beſides, the Roots, if not cut away on the inſide with a keen Spade every other year, will run into the Beds, and draw from the Flowers much of their nouriſhment: alſo it muſt be kept cut, and ſheared three times every year at leaſt; whereas a Garden ſet with Rails is free from all theſe inconveniences, preſently in perfection, and kept with little labour, onely rolling the great Alleys, ſmoothing the reſt, and weeding the Beds; which, though often ſtirred and turned over in taking up Roots, mending the Soil with ſifted Dung, or planting again, you need not fear to loſe the Level, the Rails will ſtill direct you: and as the Ground ſinks, the ſame muſt be raiſed again with good Earth mingled with Lime and Dung, which hath lay en on an heap to rot the beſt part of a year, that it may be ſifted and imployed to that purpoſe. And as I told you in the former Garden, when you earth up theſe Beds, lay them not flat, but ſomething round towards the middle, eſpecially if the Ground be apt to hold wet. The greateſt care, skill and curioſity is required in the ordering, diſpoſing, planting and preſerving each rare Plant and tender Flower, wherewith this Garden is to be furniſhed, and, although you may find ample direction at the end of each Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (where the particulars are inſerted) for the doing thereof, yet a word or two in this place will be neceſſary, for the placing ſome Plants and Flowers in this Garden, which we deſign to be of thirty yards ſquare, with a railed Fret of twenty three diviſions, and a latticed Border; and firſt we will begin with the Walls; thoſe on that ſide open to the South, or South-eaſt, I would have planted with the beſt <hi>Peaches</hi> and <hi>Nectorines,</hi> ſet twelve foot aſunder, and an <hi>Indian Geſmine</hi> and <hi>double Clematis</hi> in the middle betwixt thoſe Trees that ſtand next to the corners, and a <hi>double-flowered Pomgranate</hi> betwixt each of the other; the Eaſt and Weſt ſides with the beſt <hi>Plums</hi> and <hi>Cherries;</hi> and the North ſide (if the Walls be high) with the beſt <hi>Pears</hi> grafted in <hi>Quince</hi>-ſtocks, and betwixt every two of theſe Trees a tall ſtandard <hi>Roſe</hi>-tree, ordered in ſuch manner as in the Chapter of <hi>Roſes</hi> is directed, that each may bear ſeveral coloured <hi>Roſes</hi> on one ſtock. The Borders to the Walls are beſt to plant <hi>Auricula, red Primroſes, Hepaticaes, double Roſe-champion, double Nonſuch, double Dames-violet,</hi> the beſt <hi>Wall-flowers, double Stock-gilliflowers,</hi> and many other things you will find directed to be planted under Walls. The inner ſide of the Lattice is to be ſet round about with ſeveral ſorts of fine <hi>Roſes,</hi> cut near the ground, that the new Shoots may be wound into the Lattice all over, and no place left bare, the which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50511:17"/>
muſt be ſeaſonably cut on the top eaven with the Rail, and alſo on the ſides, ſo in two or three years you will have a noble Hedge of <hi>Roſes,</hi> which will be an excellent ornament to the Garden. The Border next this <hi>Roſe-hedge</hi> is chiefly intended to place Pots upon, on all ſides, with the beſt <hi>Gilliflowers, Auricula's, Myrtles, Olean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and all other potted Plants, onely the edge next the Rail is to be ſet with all the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Crocus,</hi> mingling and placing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſuch as are of a ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Now for planting the Beds in the Fret, you muſt conſider every piece, and place the Roots ſo as thoſe of a kind ſet in ſeveral Beds may anſwer one another; as in the corners of each Bed the beſt <hi>Crown-Imperials, Lilies, Martagons,</hi> and ſuch tall Flowers; in the middles of the five Squares great Tufts of the beſt <hi>Pionies,</hi> and round about them ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Cyclamen;</hi> the reſt with <hi>Daffodils, Hyacinths,</hi> and ſuch like: the ſtreight Beds are fit for the beſt <hi>Tulips,</hi> where account may be kept of them: <hi>Ranunculus</hi> and <hi>Anemonies</hi> alſo require particular Beds; the reſt may be ſet all over with the more ordinary ſorts of <hi>Tulips, Frittillaries, bulbed Iris,</hi> and all other kinds of good Roots, in ſuch ſort as you will find directed where they are deſcribed. And every year, as your ſtock increaſeth, you may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them according to your own fancy, or alter the places of any Roots that loſe their Fibres, at your pleaſure; but ſuch Flowers, whoſe Roots retain them, are conſiderately to be placed at firſt, where they may ſtand divers years without removing.</p>
            <p>It will be requiſite to have in the middle of one ſide of this <hi>Flower-garden</hi> a handſom Octangular Somer-houſe, roofed every way, and finely painted with Landskips, and other conceits, furniſhed with Seats about, and a Table in the middle, which ſerveth not onely for delight and entertainment, to fit in and behold the beauties of the Flowers, but for many other neceſſary purpoſes; as to put the Roots of <hi>Tulips</hi> and other Flowers in, as they are taken up, upon Papers, with the names upon them, untill they be dried, that they may be wrapped up and put in Boxes; for writing the names, both in planting and taking up, of all Flowers, in order as you diſpoſe them: for ſhelter in caſe of a ſudden ſhowre of rain, and divers other purpoſes you will find this Houſe to be fit for, which is indeed a thing ſo neceſſary, that it cannot (with any convenience) be wanting, and therefore ought to be conſidered in the ſetting up of the Walls, wherein it is to be placed, ſo that it come not further into the Garden than the juſt breadth of the Border, for putting of it out of ſquare.</p>
            <p>Theſe Gardens will not be maintained and kept well furniſhed, without a Nurcery, as well of Stocks for Fruits, as of Flowers and Seedlings, where many pretty Concluſions may be practiſed for the raiſing of new varieties of divers kinds, which is indeed the principal part of a <hi>Floriſt:</hi> and here you may yearly make your Hot Bed, for the raiſing of choice Annuals. In the ſide of this Nurcery you ſhould alſo have a convenient Houſe to put in ſuch neceſſary Tools as are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50511:18"/>
to be uſed about the Gardens, as a Skreen, a fine Wier-riddle, two Spades, a bigger and a leſſer, likewiſe Shovels, and Howes of ſeveral ſizes, a Pruining-hook, Grafting-knives, a Saw, a Chiſſel and Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, as alſo a ſmall Pen-knife for Inoculating, and laying of <hi>Gilliflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> a Line and Rule, Trowels of ſeveral ſizes, a handſom Hammer, with two pair of Garden-ſhears, and two Iron Rakes, a bigger and longer in the head, and a ſhorter with the Teeth thicker ſet, with ſeveral Baskets of Twigs, and Beſoms, to ſweep and carry away the clenſings of the Gardens; as alſo for the keeping of Roots after they are taken up, Seeds, and ſuch like things; but chiefly for the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing your <hi>Greens</hi> and other tender Plants in Winter; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ought to have a Stove, or raiſed Hearths in ſeveral places, that with a ſmall Fire you may gently attemper the Air in time of hard Froſts. Alſo in this Nurcery there ſhould be always kept a proviſion of Dung of ſeveral ſorts, as that of Neats, Hogs, Horſes and Sheep, Pigeons and Poultrey, each of theſe laid ſeverally on heaps, the four firſt mixed with Lime, and all of them covered with Earth, to putrifie and rot, that they may be ready to ſift, and ſupply the <hi>Flower-garden</hi> on all occaſions: for if your Ground be hot and ſandy, Neats dung with Lime is the beſt; if cold and inclining to clay, that of Horſes, Pigeons or Poultry is good to help it; for <hi>Fruit-trees</hi> Hogs dung well rotted is good, eſpecially in hot Grounds; for <hi>Gilliflowers</hi> Sheeps dung, for <hi>Auricula</hi> Neats dung ſifted, with little Earth in it; old Wood-pile earth and Willow earth are both good for tender Plants that will not endure Dung. Theſe ſeveral Compoſts being had in readineſs, and applied with diſcretion, all the noble Plants and Flowers, whoſe Deſcriptions hereafter follow, by the Rules there ſet down may be increaſed, preſerved, and kept in their beſt perfection.</p>
            <p>The convenience of Water to theſe Gardens is very conſiderable, and if it be to be drawn or pumped out of a Well, a Ciftern is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, which filled, and let ſtand in the Sun two or three days, will be fit to water any young or tender Plant whatſoever: for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you ſhould have three Watering-pots, one of the ordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of Tin or white Iron, with a Head full of ſmall holes; another with a Pipe onely to let out the water; a third of Earth, with a ſmall neck, and many ſmall holes in the bottom: the firſt is to water Plants in Somer; the ſecond to water Pots with rank water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the dung of Sheep, Pigeons or Poultrey hath been imbibed, that it may be put to the Roots of <hi>Gilliflowers,</hi> and other houſed Plants, without wetting or ſtaining the Leaves or Branches; the third being put into water will fill from the bottom, which will ſtay in ſo long as you ſtop out the air with your Thumb at the top; this fitly ſerveth to water young and tender Seedlings of <hi>Auricula,</hi> and ſuch like, without waſhing the Earth from them; for by the motion of your Thumb you may cauſe the water to fall gently upon them, more or leſs, as you ſhall deſire. It is alſo neceſſary to have a ſmall Pump, either of Wood or white Iron, about a yard long, with a Sucker and Sweep like ordinary Pumps, onely the lower end, and alſo the hole in the end of the Pipe from whence the water iſſueth, if made of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50511:18"/>
Wood, are to be covered with Plates full of holes: with this Pump, being put into a Pail or Cowl of water, you may ſoon water a whole Garden; but the chiefeſt uſe of it is, to eject water up into Wall-trees to waſh away Mill-dews, Caterpillars, and other noiſom ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, as alſo to cauſe the Fruits in hot and dry ſeaſons to be fairer, and to ripen much the better.</p>
            <p>And now, becauſe laying of Branches, planting by Cuttings, Budding, and the Hot Bed, are often mentioned in the following Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, it will be neceſſary, for the avoiding of Repetition, in this place to inform ſuch as are to learn how theſe ſeveral Operations are to be performed.</p>
            <p>And firſt for the laying of <hi>Gilliflowers,</hi> make choice of ſuch Slips as are ſtrongeſt and fitteſt to lay, prune the ſides and ends of the top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves, and under the middlemoſt joynt cut the ſtalk half through, and ſlit the ſame upwards to the next joynt; make a hole in the Earth ſomething wide, and gently bend it down thereinto with a ſmall hooked ſtick to keep it from riſing, then turn up the head of the Slip that the ſlit may open, in which poſture hold it with one hand and earth it up with the other, preſsing it down to keep the Slip upright; laſtly water it. Now there are ſome good Slips that grow ſo far from the ground that they cannot be laid therein; in this caſe we make uſe of ſmall Pots with a ſlit in the one ſide, through which we draw the prepared Slip into the Pot, holding it down, and covering the ſlit with a thin plate of Lead provided for the purpoſe, bending the upper end over the edge of the Pot to ſtay it, turning up the Slip, and filling the Pot with fine rich Earth preſſed down to keep it from riſing. Theſe Slips, Pots, and all other Slips laid, muſt be often watered, which will cauſe them to get roots the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The beſt time for laying of <hi>Gilliflowers</hi> is from the middle of <hi>June</hi> to the ſame time in <hi>July;</hi> the ſooner the better, provided the Slips be well grown; hard enough to endure cutting and bending down. In the beginning of <hi>September</hi> you may take them off with Earth about them, and ſet them in Beds or Pots filled with good Earth before prepared; place theſe Pots in the ſhade, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gently water them, but take heed of too much wet, leſt it rot the ſmall fibres, and ſo deſtroy the young Plants; which, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of great Rains, ought to be ſheltered with a ſhelf of thin Boards provided for the purpoſe, which place not too near them, that they may not want air.</p>
            <p>Now for the laying of <hi>Roſes, Gaſmines, Jreens,</hi> and other woody Plants, after directed to be raiſed by Layers, make choice of ſuch a Launce or Branch as may eaſily be bended to the ground; thoſe Shoots of the ſame year are beſt, and root ſooneſt; cut it half through on the under-ſide at a knot or joynt if it have any, then ſlit the ſame upward two or three inches long, and prick the Bark thorough with a blunt-pointed Awl, in divers places about the ſlit; take off the tops of all laid Plants except <hi>Greens,</hi> then make a wide hole to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50511:19"/>
hook it down, and proceed as in <hi>Gilliflowers.</hi> In ſuch Plants as are unapt to root, bind the upper end of the ſlit very hard with a Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thred or Wier, which will ſtop the ſap, and haſten the effect deſired; and fail not to put ſome rank Earth about the place layed. The beſt time to lay <hi>Greens,</hi> or indeed any other Plants, is about the middle of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> that they may prepare for rooting at the Spring: theſe Layers having paſſed a year in the ground, will be ready to be taken off; and if you find them well rooted, it will be ſeaſonable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them; otherwiſe they may ſtay a year longer. All Layers muſt be frequently watered, which will cauſe them to root the better.</p>
            <p>Cuttings are to be taken as ſoon as the Sap begins to riſe, and cut ſloping from a knot or joynt, at the lower end, like a Deers foot, and left about a foot long; make a deep Trench and lay them therein a little ſloping, fill the Trench with good Earth preſſed down ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hard, within two fingers of the ſmaller ends. All Plants that will grow of Cutting, will root ſooner being layed, but Cuttings (of ſuch Plants as we have not our ſelves) may be had of others, and in that caſe chiefly to be uſed. Theſe Cuttings muſt be often water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the former.</p>
            <p>As for Budding or Inoculating of <hi>Roſes,</hi> it is performed after the ſame manner as that of Fruits, where among the ſeveral ways of Grafting you will find ample direction for the doing thereof.</p>
            <p>When you are to make a Hot Bed, caſt all your Horſe-dung and wet Litter on a heap, in a corner of the Stable, that is of a fortnights gathering, more or leſs, according to your ſtore; then in the place where you intend to make it, knock in four Stakes, which muſt be left a yard at leaſt above ground, place them at the corners, ſo that the Bed may be four foot broad, and of what length you pleaſe, then lay the Horſe-dung with the wet Litter betwixt the Stakes ſuitably, not more ſhort dung in one place than another, untill you have rais'd it two foot high, which tread down hard all over, and let not one place be ſofter than another; then in the ſame manner raiſe it two foot higher, which tread down as the former, and ſo proceed untill you have raiſed the Bed a full yard high after it is hard trodden; which done, knock in more Stakes about it, beat up the ſides cloſe, and wrap it about with large ropes of Hay, or long Litter, two wreaths above the dung, then take ſome of the Earth of an old hot Bed, or of the beſt in your <hi>Kitchin-garden,</hi> and ſift it, which lay on your Bed four inches thick; arch it over with ſmall Poles, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it with Mats, Hair-cloth, or Canvas, which will cauſe it to heat in four or five days, then give it air, and when the violent heat is over ſow your Seeds, and cover the Bed again; the next day, if you find the Bed over hot, give it more air; if too cold, caſt ſome Straw on the covering untill the heat return, which by thruſting your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into the Earth you may find whether too hot or cold; and by this means by airing and covering you may keep the Bed in a conſtant
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50511:19"/>
temper, which ſhould be warm rather than hot. When the Seeds come up, give them air to dry the moiſture raiſed by the heat of the Bed; and for your choiceſt Seeds, cover them from the Sun with Glaſſes raiſed to give them air, and ſome part of the day take them off, to acquaint the young Seedlings with the Sun by degrees, which grown ſtrong, take up and plant in rich Earth in your Garden, but keep them from the mid-day Sun untill they are well ſetled in their new lodging.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now give you ſome Draughts for Gardens, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to acquaint you with our Plants and Flowers.</p>

                  <p>All theſe Plants are commonly ſet in Caſes, and with <hi>Orenges</hi> and tender Plants houſed in Winter, and increaſed by Layers after the manner before directed.

means, rather chuſing to leave ſome part of the Roots uncovered, than to place them too much under ground; as ſoon as they are ſet water them, and keep them ſhelter'd from Wind and Sun untill they have taken root; after a fortnight you may by degrees acquaint them with the Air, and when you find they have gotten ſtrength, ſet them abroad. The ſame order is to be uſed with ſuch Layers as you ſhall take off to plant in Caſes in <hi>Auguſt.</hi>

In <hi>March,</hi> when the great Froſts are paſt, open the doors, and give them Sun and Air by degrees, a little at firſt, which increaſe with the Spring; about the end of <hi>April</hi> ſet them forth, and waſh them clean (eſpecially the <hi>Greens</hi>) with a Watering-pot from duſt and cobwebs; and you muſt not forget while they are in the houſe to water them gently, eſpecially in <hi>November,</hi> and after long Froſts, but let not the water touch the Leaves of any of the <hi>Greens,</hi> and chuſe rather to give houſed Plants too little water than too much. As ſoon as the Heats begin, cover the Earth in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſome conſiderable thickneſs with Moſs, it will keep the Earth moiſt and from clinging, and water them as you find cauſe. Every Spring and Autumn, that is, a little before you ſet forth your Plants, and before you houſe them, you muſt take ſome of the Earth out of the Caſes, and open the reſt with a Fork or other fit tool, not hurting the roots of the Plants, and fill them up again with rank Earth, two parts Dung, well rotted and preſerved for that and ſuch like purpoſes.</p>

                  <p>All <hi>Roſes</hi> are hardy enough, and will endure the Froſts in Winter, and the better the ſoil is you ſet them in, the better they will thrive, and the fairer will be the flowers; they are uſually diſpoſed up and down the Garden in buſhes, and under walls, and ſet in rows or hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſupported and kept in on either ſide; the ſeveral-coloured <hi>Roſes</hi> intermixed and well placed, blowing together, will make a moſt gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and glorious proſpect.

Theſe Rules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved, we may expect to enjoy the full delight of theſe beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Roſes,</hi> as I my ſelf have often done by my own practice in divers Trees ſo handled, which have yearly born ſtore of fair flowers, when thoſe that were natural, notwithſtanding all the helps I could uſe, have not brought forth one that was kindly, but all of them either broken, or as it were blaſted.</p>

                  <p>And as theſe ſtately Flowers are eſteemed, ſo are they valued, one root being uſually ſold with us at all prices, from a penny (I may ſay with modeſty) to five pounds; but in other Countries where Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are more affected, at far higher rates. Such is their rarity and excellence, and ſo numerous are the varieties, that it is not poſsible any one perſon in the world ſhould be able to expreſs, or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the half of them, every Spring diſcovering many new diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, never before obſerved, either ariſing from the Seeds of ſome choice kinds, the altering of off-ſets, or by the buſie and ſecret working of Nature upon ſeveral ſelf-colours, in different ſoils and ſituations, together with the help of Art: Of all which plentifully in the end of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The diviſion of <hi>Tulips</hi> according to <hi>Gerard, Parkinſon, Cluſius,</hi> and <hi>Ferrarius,</hi> is into three ſorts, <hi>Praecoces, Medias,</hi> and <hi>Seretinas,</hi> early, middle, and late flowering <hi>Tulips,</hi> whereas indeed there are but two primary diſtinct kinds, <hi>Praecoces,</hi> and <hi>Serotinas;</hi> theſe having other notable differences, beſides their time of flowering, which from the firſt to the laſt, is as diſtant in the <hi>Praecoces,</hi> as that of thoſe called <hi>Medias</hi> to the <hi>Serotinas;</hi> ſo according to their rule, we might as well divide the early as the later, and ſo make four ſorts out of two; yet not to be thought ſingular, I ſhall not alter the old me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, but ſet down a plentiful variety of each, under ſuch names as they are generally received and known by, written after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> faſhion, that perſons unexpert in the Orthography of Forein Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, may be able to write and pronounce them; beginning with the beſt known and more ordinary ſorts, and ſo proceed to better.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt difference of <hi>Tulips</hi> is in the flowers, as the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of colour, manner of marking, bottoms, chives or Tamis, big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, faſhion, and manner of growing; the which after one general deſcription of the whole Plant, ſhall be particularly expreſſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by each flower by name and face may be known and diſtinguiſhed.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THe early, middle, and later flowering Tulip,</hi> ſpringeth out of the ground, with leaves folded one within another, which opening by degrees become broad, thick, long and hollow, turning up the edges, and holding water falling thereon; they are commonly three in number, but ſometimes in old-rooted Plants four or five, of a whitiſh green colour, with whiter edges, eſpecially in thoſe of the <hi>Praecoces,</hi> whereby they may be known from the other ſorts, whoſe leaves are of a freſher green; the ſtalk with the flower cometh up in the middle of the leaves, which do riſe therewith, and compaſs it at certain unequal diſtances; many of the <hi>Praecoces</hi> bending to the ground, but before they flower, drawn by the Sun, ſtand upright as all the reſt do; the ſtalks of the <hi>Praecoces</hi> are commonly not above a foot high, and many of them much lower, but thoſe of the <hi>Medias</hi> and <hi>Serotinas</hi> far higher: they all bear uſually but one flower on a ſtalk, which ſtandeth upright, in faſhion like unto a <hi>Lily,</hi> compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ſix leaves, green at the firſt and cloſed, which warmed by the Sun, open and change into divers ſeveral glorious colours, variouſly mixed, edged, ſtriped, feathered, garded, agotted, marbled, flaked, or ſpecled, even to admiration; the leaves of ſome of them being round pointed, of others ſharp, and in ſome three of one faſhion and three of the other: The colour of the bottoms and Tamis, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the <hi>Mediums</hi> and <hi>Serotinas,</hi> doth alſo notably differ from each other; for in ſome they will be white, yellow, or ſtraw-colour; and in others blew, black, or purple, deeper or lighter; ſome of theſe flowers are ſweeter than others, and many of them have little or no ſcent at all: in the middle of the flower ſtandeth a long green head, commonly three ſquare (which is the Seed-veſſel) compaſſed about with ſix chives, tipt with pendents (which are thoſe after the <hi>French</hi> we call Tamis) in colour uſually anſwerable to that of the bottom, which often changeth; for when a red, or purple flower, with a blew, or other dark-coloured bottom and Tamis marketh well with white, the bottom will be white alſo, the bottom running up into the leaves, which is a prime cauſe of the well marking thereof, but the Tamis remain without alteration, whereby the flower may be known through all the various mutations thereof, the rule holding certain in moſt of the beſt flowers. After the leaves of the flower are faln, the head or Seed-veſſel groweth biger, rounder, and longer, containing uſually ſix rows of flat, thin, brown, griſtly Seed. The roots are ſome rounder and bigger than others, ſharp at the upper end; and in thoſe roots that will bear flowers, either forked, or ſhewing two points to put forth two leaves, but in ſuch as will not bear, but one: the bottom is big and round, with a little woolly eminence on the one ſide thereof, from whence the Fibres come forth; on the other ſide in ſuch roots as have born flowers, there is a hollow chanel where the ſtalk grew, which yearly ſhifteth from ſide to ſide, ariſing immediately from that eminence which is in the bottom of every root, but more in ſome than others. Theſe roots are compoſed of

ſeveral thick skins, folded within each other, and covered with a thin brown Coat, which is every year renewed, and the old caſt off.</p>

                     <hi>Tenebris</hi> is a large ſtrong flower, of a dark deep red colour, like that called <hi>de Roy,</hi> with ſmall veins of Peach-colour, a ſmall pale yellow bottom, and dark brown Tamis.</p>
                  <p>All theſe <hi>Tulips,</hi> and many others may be had of Mr. <hi>Rickets</hi> of <hi>Hogeſden</hi> near <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe beautiful flowers (warmed by the Raies of the returning Sun) diſcloſe their bravery, to ſalute the firſt approaches of the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Spring; the <hi>Praecoces</hi> flowering from the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> untill a good part of <hi>April</hi> be ſpent, at which time the <hi>Medias</hi> begin to diſplay their noble colours, and about the end of that moneth, or the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> are in the height of glory, and when paſt, the <hi>Serotinas</hi> ſucceed, and commonly continue the greateſt part of that month.</p>
                  <p>The roots of all <hi>Tulips</hi> loſe their Fibres every year, and are to be taken up as ſoon as the ſtalks are dry, which is commonly about <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer,</hi> and kept dry out of the ground untill the time of ſetting them, which in cold grounds is about the end of <hi>September,</hi> and in hot and more fertil grounds <hi>October.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The more common and ordinary kinds may be ſet in borders, or ſpaces in knots, according to the fancy of the owner; but for the richer and more noble ſorts, they will deſerve to be lodged in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular beds by themſelves, provided for that purpoſe, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hereafter directed.</p>
                  <p>When the roots are ready to be taken up, make choice of a fair calm day, and in ſtiff or hard grounds, a long hollow Trowel will be fit for the purpoſe; but in the beſt light ground, it may be done with the hands onely.</p>
                  <p>As the ſeveral flowers are taken up, lay them on papers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the names are written, and place them open upon ſome boarded flore, where they muſt ſo remain to dry about twenty days; then take away the dead Fibres and looſe outer skins, and ſuch off-ſets or young roots as will eaſily part from the old; which done, it will be neceſſary to wrap up your beſt roots eſpecially, in freſh well dried pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50511:47"/>
and on the out ſides to write the name of each flower, which may be kept with their off-ſets with them, untill the middle of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> at which time the off-ſets muſt be Set in a good bed prepared for that purpoſe; the old bearing roots left in the papers untill the time fore-mentioned for planting them.</p>
                  <p>After your roots are ſecured in Boxes, it will be very neceſſary often to look them over, leſt any ſhould be mouldy, as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, which muſt be gently wiped off with a woollen cloath; the root dried before the fire, and ſo put up again into a freſh paper.</p>
                  <p>The roots thus carefully diſpoſed, it will be time to prepare a place to plant them, which for the beſt bearing roots is a bed or beds, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your ſtore, a yard broad, and in length according to your ground, bordered with rails, and filled two foot deep, with the lighteſt, freſheſt, and fineſt ſifted earth that can be gotten. Theſe beds will contain ſix roots in every row croſs the bed, which with a line may be exactly divided, and the roots placed accordingly, but before they are ſet, the number of roots in each ſort muſt be conſidered, and the poſition of each particular deſigned in a paper, according to this example,

whereby reckoning the numbers, the flowers may be ſet, and after known before and after their time of bearing, and ſo by the ſame paper taken up and diſpoſed as before is expreſſed. In placing theſe roots, ſome ſet the ſaddeſt colours towards the ſides, and the lighteſt in the middle; but a hanſome mixture is beſt, not ſetting too many dark or light colours together, though different from each other, nor to mingle the <hi>Praecoces</hi> with the <hi>Medias,</hi> but placing each ſort in a particular bed; when theſe noble <hi>Tulips</hi> begin to riſe up to flower, it is very neceſſary to cover the bed with a Canvas tilt (ſupported with a frame, and raiſed like a <hi>Herſe</hi> that it touch not the flowers) eſpecially in the night to prevent Froſts, which often curdle the buds, and quite ſpoil the beauty of the flowers, beſides it defends them from hail and great rains, as alſo from the ſcortching heat of the Sun, and ſo
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50511:48"/>
cauſe them to continue long in flower. This tilt or canvas covering may be taken off before the time of flowering in fair days, and to refreſh them with ſome gentle ſhowers, but kept covered in the night; and when fully blown, give them not above an hours Sun in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and as much in the evening, if the ſeaſon be hot, otherwiſe they will endure more.</p>
                  <p>As for the more ordinary ſorts of <hi>Tulips</hi> that are ſet in borders, or ſpaces in knots, and no account kept of them, ſuch, if the ground be good when they are ſet, may ſtand two years without taking up, but not longer, in reſpect the off-ſets that riſe from them, will cauſe the flowers to be ſmall and weak, and all the nouriſhment proper to this Plant exhauſted, ſo that before they are ſet again in the ſame place, the earth muſt be changed for that which is freſh.</p>
                  <p>After the flowers are faln, break off the head or ſeed-veſſel from the ſtalk of every flower, unleſs of ſuch you reſerve for ſeed, which will cauſe them to dry down the ſooner, and alſo fortifie the roots.</p>
                  <p>Although the roots of <hi>Tulips</hi> are for the moſt part hardy, and of long continuance, yet ſometimes ſome of the beſt kinds will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with diſeaſes, notwithſtanding our greateſt diligence and care in their preſervation, which hapneth to the roots of ſome, whilſt out of ground, and to others after they are ſet. For the firſt, in obſerving the root of any good flower, if it appear rivelled or crumpled on the outſide, and feel ſoft and ſpungy, it is a manifeſt ſign of a conſumption, which to prevent, wrap it up in Wooll dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Sallet Oyl, and place it where it may receive ſome little warmth from the fire; and abouts the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> ſet it in the ground, putting ſome ſoot made by a wood-fire, mixed with ſand, about it, covering the place with a pot, the bottom turned upward, to keep it from wet, until the fibres are come forth, which will be by the end of <hi>September</hi> or not at all. With ſuch roots thus handled it often happeneth, that though ſome of the outer folds rot and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, yet the middle and heart will remain ſound, and in two or three years bear a flower again.</p>
                  <p>Now for ſuch defects as happen to theſe roots after they are ſet, and put forth green leaves; if any of them begin to fade and wither, open the earth to the bottom of the root to find the cauſe, and if the root be moiſt, and feel ſoft, it is paſt help; but if any thing hard, it may be recovered by putting ſoot and dry ſand to the root, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it, as in the former, leaving the place ſomething open that it may dry down the ſooner: In hot days take off the pot, and take up the root as ſoon as the fibres are gone, and keep it in Wooll wet in Oyl near the fire; laſt ſet it again after the manner of the former, by this means many good flowers have been ſaved, which neglected had been undoubtedly loſt.</p>
                  <p>And as we induſtriouſly endeavor to recover ſuch ſickly roots of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50511:48"/>
choice flowers, ſo purpoſely we infect others more vulgar with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by taking up the roots a little before they come to flower, and laying them in the Sun, to abate their luxury, and cauſe them to come better marked the year following; this I have often done with ſtrong and luſty roots of the <hi>Paſs Oudinard, Paſs Cittadel, Paſs He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, Agot Robine, Turloone, Widows,</hi> and ſuch like ordinary flowers, and commonly found the ſucceſs anſwer my expectation in many, and ſome of them to come ſo well marked, that they might be taken for much better flowers than they are, eſpecially if a new name be put upon them, as ſome flower-merchants about <hi>London</hi> uſe to do.</p>
                  <p>The next thing to be conſidered, is the manner of raiſing new varieties, a practice fit for the beſt <hi>Floriſts;</hi> and this is effected chiefly, by ſowing the ſeeds of ſome choice flowers, as alſo by the changing of off-ſets, and the ſecret working of nature upon divers ſelf-colours.</p>
                  <p>For ſeeds, you muſt be ſure to make choice of ſuch flowers as have ſtrong ſtalks, and the ſeed-veſſel three ſquare, of ſuch kinds as are moſt conſtantly well marked, and ſuch as have the bottoms and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis, either blew or purple, which is rarely to be found in the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coces,</hi> whoſe bottoms are commonly white or yellow; yet there is one excellent kind before deſcribed by the name of the <hi>Omen,</hi> that aptly marketh with three colours, and hath the bottom and Tamis both blew, from the ſeeds whereof doubtleſs many fine varieties may be raiſed; next unto this the <hi>Florizante, Morillion Cramoſine, Periſhot, Admiral Encuſen,</hi> and the reſt of the well-marked <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coces</hi> are not without hope; but from the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> and the varieties of <hi>Edgers,</hi> few better than the originals are to be expected.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Medias,</hi> or middle flowering <hi>Tulips,</hi> afford many more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent varieties fit for this purpoſe, as the <hi>Adoratea of Holland, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thago, Paragon Jeron, Doctor Bolſon, Paragon Floriſon, Royal Tudart, Orient Virgin, Diana, Angellica, Cedanella, Princeſs Turgiana,</hi> all the <hi>Brabaſons, bew Anvers,</hi> and divers others: All theſe named being well-marked flowers, of different colours, with blew or purple bottoms and Tamis, not apt to run, but abiding conſtant to the laſt; and therefore all flowers of hope, and ſuch as few lovers and collectors of flowers are without.</p>
                  <p>Commonly we make choice of ſuch we intend for ſeed, when they are in flower, but in ſo doing we often fail of our purpoſe, for that the roots loſe their fibres, and the ſtalks dry before the ſeeds come to be half ripe; to prevent which, make choice of the ſtrongeſt roots you have, of ſuch flowers you deſire to ſeed, and ſet them in that part of your Garden moſt expoſed to the Sun, ſix or ſeven inches in the ground; by which means you may gain good ripe ſeeds, from almoſt any flower, as I have found by experience.</p>
                  <p>About the middle of <hi>July,</hi> ſooner or later, as the Summer is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50511:49"/>
hotter or colder, the ſeeds will be ready to gather, which may be known by the dryneſs of the ſtalks, and the opening of the ſeed-veſſels, which gather, and take up the roots, letting the ſeeds remain in the pods until the end of <hi>September,</hi> and then take them out, which being cleanſed from chaff, may be ſowed in beds of fine ſifted earth, eſpecially the more ordinary ſorts; but thoſe of the choiceſt flowers, muſt be ſowed in Boxes filled with the fineſt earth that can be gotten, in reſpect the young roots are apt to run down deep in the earth, ſo that in beds many of them will be loſt: Sow not theſe ſeeds too thick, nor cover them more than a finger thick; in <hi>March</hi> following they will come up with ſmall leaves like graſs, and in <hi>April</hi> weed, and gently water them, as often as you ſhall find occaſion. About <hi>Midſummer,</hi> two years after the ſowing, you may take them up, cleanſe the ſmall roots, and ſet them again in rows at a wider di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſo every other year until they come to bear flowers, ſtill altering the ground with freſh earth and ſifted compoſt before you ſet them again; it will be ſix or ſeven years before the <hi>Praecoces</hi> will bear flowers, but the <hi>Medias</hi> a year or two ſooner; when you ſee the flowers, mark out the beſt, and give them new names, caſting away the common reds, yellows, and purples, and reſerving ſuch ſelf-colours chiefly as are light, with blew, purple, or black bottoms and Tamis, for ſuch often change into fairer flowers, and better marked, than many that ſhew their beſt at firſt flowering.</p>
                  <p>And although probably many fine flowers may be raiſed from the ſeeds of thoſe well-marked flowers before mentioned, yet ſuch as have a good collection of <hi>Modes</hi> or ſelf-colours, obſerving what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are apteſt to change, and by the bottoms running up into the leaves become well marked with ſeveral colours; doubtleſs by ſowing the ſeeds of ſuch, the product maybe as anſwerable to expectation; and though they come at firſt wholly of one colour, yet if that be either <hi>Orenge,</hi> Brimſton, Hair, Dove, Gredeline, <hi>Iſabella,</hi> Shamway, or any other light or ſtrange colour, they are to be eſteemed, for in a year or two, many ſuch have changed into good marked flowers, and ſo with all their increaſe continued.</p>
                  <p>To haſten which effect, let ſuch of your colours as are ſtrong and luxuriant, be ſet in lean and hungry, but freſh ground, and the next year after in that which is fat and well manured; and ſo yearly remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to contrary ſoils, untill you obtain the end deſired; and ſuch flowers may be ſet in your Garden, and the reſt continued. The like courſe is held with off-ſets, to cauſe them to alter from the original, as many have done, for the <hi>General Bole</hi> came from the <hi>brown An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> the <hi>Cedanella</hi> from the <hi>Zeablom,</hi> and many fine flowers from the <hi>Brabaſon, Turloon,</hi> and <hi>Widows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the planting of the beſt <hi>Tulips,</hi> a proviſion of manured, freſh, light ſandy earth is neceſſary, yearly to make new beds for them, or by taking away that wherein they grew to ſupply the place; for if <hi>Tulips</hi> (as many good <hi>Floriſts</hi> conclude) be ſet twice in the ſame
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50511:49"/>
earth, they will languiſh and decay for want of agreeable nouriſhment; yet if you have ſtore of Neats dung mixed with ſand, that hath lain on a heap two or three years, the ſame ſifted, and in <hi>Auguſt</hi> well mingled with the earth of your bed in any good air will be ſufficient; many about <hi>London</hi> complain of the earth, when indeed the fault is in the air. I have ſet my beſt <hi>Tulips</hi> twenty years ſucceſsively in one bed, where by the means preſcribed, they have proſpered to my wiſh, and often beyond my expectation.</p>

                  <p>Theſe are the beſt varieties of Spring <hi>Crocus</hi> that hitherto have come to our knowledge, there are ſome others inferiour to theſe, which I have purpoſely omitted, and I doubt not but many other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties may be raiſed from the ſeeds of theſe, being ſowed and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up by induſtrious lovers of this delight; and as in the <hi>Colchicum,</hi> there are ſome that bring forth their flowers in the Spring, ſo there are ſome <hi>Crocuses</hi> that flower in Autumn, which are next to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</p>

                  <p>And another that hath yellow falling leaves, sky-coloured arches, and top-leaves of a murrey purple.</p>
                  <p>And there is another whoſe falling leaves are yellow, the arches and top-leaves of a fair hair-colour, and another of a ſadder and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler brown colour.</p>

                  <p>There are three other more common varieties, which are called <hi>French Corn-flags,</hi> two that bear red flowers, the one a little bigger than the other, and one that is Aſh-colour; and we have another called the <hi>Italian Corn-flag,</hi> that beareth flowers like the common red <hi>French Corn-flag,</hi> but that they are of a ſadder red colour, and grow on both ſides the ſtalk.</p>

                     <hi>THe ſingle narrow-leaved Anemones</hi> are of a greater variety, rarity and eſteem, than the <hi>Latifoliaes:</hi> formerly we had very few of theſe flowers, and thoſe of little worth, but now of late years we are become owners of many diverſities, of divers colours, both plain, ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſtriped or marked with white, ſo that a bed ſet ſomething thick
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50511:83"/>
with the ſeveral varieties of theſe Flowers, makes a gallant ſhew, for their ſtalks are tall, and bear plentifully fair large Flowers, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſting of one row or pale of broad leaves, with a hairy head, or button in the middle, which after the Flowers are paſt grows big and long, yielding ſtore of ſmall Flat brown ſeeds, wraped in down; the green leaves are larger, grow ranker, and are more in number than thoſe of the double kinds; the roots much bigger, and apter to increaſe; and beſides the great varieties of reds, ſcarlets, purples, whites, Peach, and Roſe-colours, both plain and marked with white, there are ſome others raiſed from the ſeeds of theſe that bear gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant double flowers of ſeveral colours, as red, ſcarlet and purple; theſe either plain or ſtriped ſorts I have ſeen more reſembling the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the double <hi>latifolias,</hi> than thoſe with narrow leaves, for theſe conſiſt of many ſomething broad leaves, having no pluſh or thrum of leaves, but a ſmall head or button in the middle, ſome having but two rows of leaves, others three, and ſome ſo thick and double, that the head in the middle is not to be ſeen, untill the Flowers fall; and yet theſe kinds (eſpecially the thinner ſorts) perfect their ſeeds, from which many fine Flowers may be produced; theſe are called <hi>Herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodites,</hi> for that they partake of both kinds, as having the roots and leaves of the narrow, and the flowers of the double broad-leaved <hi>Anemones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe <hi>Anemones,</hi> both double and ſingle, bring forth their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Flowers commonly in <hi>March, April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> ſooner or later, according to the State of the Spring, and time of ſetting their roots.</p>
                  <p>In the handling and ordering of the rarer ſorts of theſe excellent Flowers, ſome more than common care is to be taken; for if the ſoil, ſituation, time and manner of planting and taking up, be not exactly obſerved, the Flowers will neither be fair, nor will the roots proſper and increaſe, but on the contrary rot, and conſume, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the beſt double kinds with narrow leaves; the ordinary, and thoſe with ſingle Flowers are more hardy.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing therefore to be conſidered, is the ſoil wherein they are to be planted, which muſt be fat and rich, the earth not too light, a rich ſandy lome earth is the beſt, wherein ſome Neats and Sheeps dung with a little lime hath been tempered, and layen long on a heap, often turned over, ſo that the dung be fully rotted, and well mixed with the earth, which being firſt ſifted through a Wyer Sive, make a bed thereof half a yard deep at the leaſt, in ſome place that is not too hot in the Sun, but ſomething ſhadowed; then about the end of <hi>September,</hi> place the roots of thoſe <hi>Anemones</hi> with broad leaves therein, ſix or eight inches aſunder, and three fingers deep in the ground, ſetting that ſide upward where you perceive ſmall emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences to put forth leaves; thoſe with narrow leaves are to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the ſame manner, only differing in the time of their ſetting, for theſe muſt be kept out of the ground in ſome dry place untill the end
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50511:84"/>
of <hi>October,</hi> and the purples a moneth longer, and then ſet in the ſame manner as the others; thoſe with broad leaves will come up before Winter, and thoſe with narrow leaves about the end of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> or ſooner if the Winter be mild, in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> if the ſeaſon be dry, they muſt be watered, which will cauſe them to thrive much the better, and to bear the fairer flowers.</p>
                  <p>If you find they like their entertainment, grow ſtrong, bear fair flowers on tall ſtalks, and proſper well, you may forbear to take up their roots untill the end of <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July;</hi> but on the contrary, if the green leaves are few, the flowers ſmall, and ſtalks ſhort, it is a manifeſt ſign of their diſlike, and that the ſoil is either too cold and poor, or elſe too hot and rank, which is far more dangerous; in this caſe they muſt be taken up as ſoon as the green leaves turn yellow, the roots put into ſand, and ſo kept in ſome dry place for a moneth at the leaſt, and then taken out, and kept in papers in ſome cool dry place, until the time of planting, for ſhould the roots remain in the ground any time after they have loſt their fibres, the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-hot, they would all, or moſt of them rot and conſume away, eſpecially if any ſtore of rain fall upon them; in the taking up of their roots, care muſt be had that they be not broken, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe with broad leaves, which muſt not be divided nor broken, until they part of themſelves, thoſe of the other kind with narrow leaves may be broken or parted with leſs prejudice, but the wholer they are kept, the better they will thrive; and although the times before mentioned be beſt for the planting and ſetting the roots of both kinds of theſe rare flowers, yet the more ordinary kinds may be kept out of the ground until the end of <hi>February,</hi> which ſome uſe to do to cauſe them to flower late after others are gone; in this practiſe it will be neceſſary to ſteep the roots four and twenty hours before you ſet them in warm water, and to plant them with ſome Willow earth under and over them, and in a more ſhady place than ordinary, elſe the heat of the Sun in the time of their flowring, will much diminiſh their beauty; ſo if you have two beds ſtored with choice varieties of <hi>Anemonies,</hi> that ſet laſt more ſhaded than the firſt, and the fore-mentioned rules obſerved, you will be ſure to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the delight of their delicate flowers part of <hi>March,</hi> all <hi>April,</hi> and the greateſt part of <hi>May,</hi> unleſs your Garden ſtand in ſome ſmoky place, where neither art nor induſtry will cauſe them to proſper, unleſs ſet in a hot bed in <hi>January,</hi> as ſome about <hi>London</hi> uſe to doe.</p>
                  <p>Now for the raiſing of new varieties of <hi>Anemones</hi> from ſeeds, choice muſt be made of the Flowers, as in <hi>Tulips;</hi> ſome of the double <hi>latifolias</hi> bring ſeeds, the richeſt ſcarlets, paleſt purples, pink, white, and sky-colours are the beſt: but in the ſingle <hi>Tenuifolias</hi> there is more choice, as red, and ſcarlets with deep white edges, all that are variegated or ſtriped with white, and in theſe the deepeſt velvet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are the beſt; but above all others thoſe that have two or three rowes of leaves, and that excellent velvet ſingle blew, deſcribed and commended by <hi>Ferarius,</hi> are chiefly to be preferred.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:50511:84"/>The ſeeds of theſe flowers will be ready to gather in <hi>May,</hi> which muſt be done as the down riſeth, elſe they will be blown away; and having gathered all your ſeeds, ſtay not as ſome direct to ſow them untill <hi>Auguſt,</hi> but let it be done by the middle of <hi>July</hi> at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, and be ſure the earth in which you ſow them be good, and finely ſifted, be it in beds or boxes, which your beſt ſeeds will deſerve.</p>
                  <p>To ſeparate the ſeeds that hang in the down, you muſt take earth that is very dry and fine, in quantity according to the ſeeds you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſow, put it in a Bowl, Trey, or Baſon, and mingle the ſeeds therewith, then ſtir and divide them with your fingers untill none of the white down appear; ſow them not too thin, for ſome will fail to come up; laſtly, cover them half a fingers thickneſs with fine rich earth, and ſo let them remain untill about a moneth after their ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then ſtrow over them a fingers thickneſs more of like earth, and ſo leave them until Winter begins, at which time they muſt be covered with peaſe-ſtraw, laid upon ſticks, that it touch not the earth, to prevent the froſts and cold nipping air; but from the time of ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſecond covering with earth, you muſt not neglect often gently to water them.</p>
                  <p>The next year after their ſowing, in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> they may be taken up, and ſet again in rowes at convenient diſtance, where they may remain until you ſee what flowers they will bear, and then diſpoſe them as they ſhall deſerve: ſome report they have had <hi>Anemones</hi> bear flowers the next, others the ſecond year from the ſowing, but I can expect few or none that are good before the third, and many will not bear untill the fourth year; but the agreeable goodneſs of the earth and air for bringing them forward is moſt conſiderable, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſure to make it as rich and good as you can, but take heed of too much dung.</p>
                  <p>If the earth of your bed, wherein you would ſet your beſt <hi>Anemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> be either too ſtiff clay, or too light ſand, it muſt be compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; Clay with brook ſand, and pearl ſand, with good freſh fat earth taken next under the Turf of ſome good paſture, well mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome lime, and old Neats dung rotted to earth; which compoſition muſt be finely ſifted before uſed; with this earth ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared make a bed half a yard deep, and therein ſet your roots, which will proſper and bear the better; if at any ſeaſon of ſetting them, you put a little Willow earth under and over the roots, it will cauſe them ſoon to put forth fibres, and thereby able to abide the Winter; yet in froſt and hard weather, it will be good to cover them that are come up with mats or peaſe-ſtraw, which take off for two or three hours, every other day, (if fair) to give the bed air, and prevent mouldineſs, which hath been the deſtruction of many a fine plant.</p>

                  <p>There are now ſeveral other nobler ſorts of <hi>Ranunculus</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> with gallant double flowers, much excelling this old kind deſcribed, the which we will inſert under thoſe names they are received, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed and known by, placing them in order according to their affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with each other, beginning with that fine variety of our old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, the former called</p>

                     <hi>Bozvell</hi> or <hi>Plumaſhe,</hi> this is in all things like the firſt old kind, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every leaf of the double flower is finely ſtriped with pale yellow, of which there are two ſorts, one ſaid to be of <hi>Paris,</hi> the other and better of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pianiſco</hi> chiefly differs from the laſt, in that the flower is a little double, and of a bloody red colour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sang de Beuf</hi> differs from the laſt, in that the flower is more thick and double, and at firſt ſeemeth to have ſmall lines of yellow in every leaf thereof, but when full blown, it is of the colour of Bulls blood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Monſter,</hi> or <hi>Gyant Ranunculus,</hi> hath thicker, rougher, and browner green leaves than any of the former, the ſtalks bigger and branched, each bearing a fair double Scarlet flower, but that on the chiefeſt ſtalk, is as big, and more double, than the faireſt <hi>Marigold,</hi> which in ſhape it much reſembleth, only the ſmall leaves of this are ſharp-pointed; there is one of this ſort whoſe flowers are leſſer, and a little ſtriped with yellow.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>RAnunculus of Aſia with ſingle flowers</hi> are of divers ſorts and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which chiefly differ from the firſt double red in the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which commonly are compoſed of five ſomething broad leaves, with a thrummy head in the middle, much reſembling a ſingle <hi>Ane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie;</hi> In ſome the flowers are red, ſome yellow, deeper or lighter; and others ſpotted and ſtriped about the edges with red, with ſeveral other pretty varieties, both of plain and mixed colours; and we have one of the <hi>Gyants</hi> race which beareth on a branched ſtalk three or four ſingle flowers, conſiſting of ſeven broad round-pointed leaves, of a greeniſh pale yellow at firſt, after milk-white, the leaves ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and tipt with reddiſh purple, and another more rare, called the <hi>Archducal Ranunculus,</hi> which hath the ſingle flower finely marked with three good colours.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Ranunculus</hi> are pretty flowers, and many of them worthy of eſteem, eſpecially the double kinds; they bring forth their beautiful flowers in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> which continue a long time before they fall.</p>
                  <p>The roots of thoſe of <hi>Candy</hi> may be taken up, and kept out of ground in Sand for ſome time, but require to be planted in <hi>September. The yellow of Aſia</hi> is hardy, and will proſper well without being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up; all the other are nice and tender, and require to be planted in rich ſandy and ranker earth than that directed for <hi>Anemones;</hi> the roots are every year to be taken up about <hi>Midſommer,</hi> well dryed and kept in Papers or Boxes, as <hi>Anemones,</hi> untill ſuch time they are to be ſet, for if they be left in the ground, or ſet too ſoon, they will come up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great Froſts, which (unleſs carefully covered) will deſtroy them. I uſe to ſet them towards the end of <hi>December,</hi> and in warm and early grounds <hi>January</hi> is ſoon enough; the roots may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſet ſeverally ſix inches aſunder, in rows, three fingers deep, where if the ſoil be agreeable, they will come up in <hi>March,</hi> and about the beginning of <hi>May</hi> bring forth gallant flowers, and much increaſe by roots; and although <hi>Ranunculus</hi> require a ranker and more ſandy earth than <hi>Anemones,</hi> yet it may be over rank; if you ſuſpect it to be ſo, when you ſet your roots, take off ſome of the earth, and in the place thereof, cover the bed about an inch thick all over with good freſh earth, taken next under the turf of ſome good Paſture, finely ſifted, and if two ſtiff, mingle it with fine brook ſand; place the roots thereon, then cover them with a little of the ſame earth, and laſtly finiſh your covering with that earth you took off your bed, ſo
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50511:86"/>
that the roots may be three inches under ground; ſome ſet their <hi>Anemones</hi> and <hi>Ranunculus</hi> in the end of <hi>September,</hi> and aſſoon as they come up, ſhelter them with ſupported Mats, which muſt (for an hour every fair day) be taken off to air the bed, and prevent mouldineſs, for if they be not carefully defended from hard Froſts and Snows, it will ſoon kill them all, therefore to avoid ſuch trouble and danger of loſs, I preferr late ſetting, as needing no attendance, or ever failing to anſwer my expectation.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> when they are come up, and begin to riſe to flower, they muſt be often well watered, for then they require moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, too much of which in the Winter deſtroys them; ſome years ſome of their roots will lye in the ground, and not ſpring at all, which take up and dry with the reſt, and they will bear flowers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the year following.</p>
                  <p>Unto theſe nobler kinds of <hi>Ranunculus,</hi> or <hi>Crow-foot,</hi> ſome others of our old acquaintance may be joyned; they are now common I muſt confeſs, yet bear fair flowers, and were they as ſtrange and nice as ſome of the former, they would be more eſteemed, theſe being too familiar to be much affected, and kept with ſo little care, that few care for them, and therefore it will ſuffice onely to name them, and ſo conclude this Chapter.</p>

                     <hi>TThe white Auricula</hi> is of ſmall variety and eſteem, the beſt is that called <hi>the Virgins milk;</hi> this hath large mealy leaves, a tall ſtrong ſtalk, with a great truſs of milk-white flowers, with ſnow-white eyes, which placed among the purples, ſets off, and adds to their glory; there are ſome that are perfectly <hi>white,</hi> and many <hi>milk-whites,</hi> but few of them of any better eſteem than the yellows.</p>

more brown hairy-ſtalks, five or ſix inches high, each bearing at the top, three, or four flowers, conſiſting of five leaves, which are large, ſharp-pointed, and of a fair rich blew colour, with ſome ſmall yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low threds in the middle; the root is long and browniſh, with many ſmall fibres annexed thereunto.

This Plant is commonly raiſed from ſeeds, ſet in a pot and ordered as in the laſt in Winter; both this and the former flower with the <hi>Auricula</hi> or a little after them.</p>
                  <p>All the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Auricula</hi> do flower in <hi>April</hi> or the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>May,</hi> and ſometimes they will flower again in the end of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> or beginning of <hi>September,</hi> but thoſe flowers that come then, are neither ſo fair, nor ſo many on one ſtalk, as thoſe of the Spring.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Bears-ears</hi> muſt be planted in ſome place that is a little ſhaded from the ſcorching heat of the Sun, the ſoil made very rich, if ſtiff with ſand &amp; ſtore of well rotted Neats-dung, &amp; therein the roots ſet a foot aſunder, for they ſpread wide, and will not thrive if they want room; the beſt way to ſet them, is to open a wide hole, leaving or raiſing a little hill in the middeſt thereof, then ſet the root thereupon, and ſpread the fibres round about it, laſtly cover and water them. After the middle of <hi>Auguſt</hi> every other year take them up, and then mend the ſoil where they grew, with ſifted Neats-dung, and having ſlipped and parted the roots, and cut off thoſe fibres that are too long, ſet them in the ſame place again; by this means you ſhall not fail to have them thrive and bear ſtore of flowers, but if you let them ſtand too long unremoved, or in poor, or ſtiff ground, you muſt expect the contrary.</p>
                  <p>The beſt ſorts of <hi>Auricula</hi> are ſet in pots, which they will well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; fill the pots almoſt half full with ſifted Neats-dung, the reſt with good ſandy earth well mixed with ſuch ſifted dung, and about the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> ſet the Plants therein, but not too deep, for the roots will be apt enough to draw downwards; place theſe pots in the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50511:94"/>
Sun all the Winter, and with Glaſſes defend them from over much wet, but do not houſe them, for they will do better in the open Air. At the Spring when they riſe to flower remove them into a place more ſhaded, and after the flowers are paſt (except thoſe you leave to ſeed) you may diſpoſe in ſome ſhady place out of the way, to make room for pots with <hi>Gilliflowers.</hi>

                  <p>The raiſing varieties of them from ſeeds is a ſecret wherewith few are well acquainted, and it is to be performed with ſomething more than common diligence, according to the rules following; After the flowers are paſt, and the ſtalks begin to grow yellow, you may obſerve in the top of that little round ſeed-veſſel, a ſmall hole, and then you may be aſſured the ſeed is almoſt ripe, and if you do not carefully look to it, will be all ſhed before you are aware; therefore as ſoon as you perceive it to be ready, cut down the ſtalks, keeping the tops upright, for if you turn them downwards, all the beſt ſeeds will fall out; then binde them in bundles, and place them upright to the Glaſs of ſome South Window, where (by ſome benefit they will receive from the Sun) they will harden, and be much the better; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> or beginning of <hi>September,</hi> prepare ſome ſquare box or boxes according to your ſtore of ſeeds, that are nine or ten inches deep, and of what breadth you pleaſe, with ſome holes in the bottom to let out water, which fill three parts full with fine ſandy ſifted earth, one half thereof being well rotted Neats dung, which mingled well together, and laid ſmooth with your Trowel, lay thereon a fingers thickneſs of fine ſifted Willow earth, or for want thereof dried Cow-dung beaten ſmall, mingled with a little good earth and ſifted, and ſow your ſeeds thereon, mingled with Wood-aſhes, which by their colour will direct you to ſow them the more ſuitably; they muſt not be ſowed too thin, for all will not come up, if they do they may eaſily be removed to another place; after the ſeeds are thus ſowed, cover them half a finger thick, with the ſame you put next under them, which preſs down lightly, and let them remain in the Sun and Air untill they begin to come up, which will be about <hi>April,</hi> and then they muſt be removed into the ſhade, and often gently watered; as ſoon as they are grown to any conſiderable bigneſs take ſome of them up, where they are too thick, and ſet them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in ſome bed prepared for that purpoſe, ſix or eight inches aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, where they may remain untill they come to bear flowers; and thoſe you leave in the box may be tranſplanted in the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> after the ſame manner, and ſo the box will be ready again to ſow more ſeeds; ſome of them will bear the Spring following, others about <hi>Auguſt</hi> the year after they were ſowed, and the reſt the Spring then next following, provided the ground you ſet them in be rich and good, otherwiſe you will loſe all the delight of your labors. Some are of opinion that the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> others the end of <hi>February,</hi> is the beſt time to ſow them, but having tryed all thoſe times, I finde that before mentioned to be the beſt; for the ſeeds are ſo ſmall that if they be kept any time out of the ground, they will be all dead. Now above all things you muſt be ſure to get the ſeeds of good

flowers, for from thence ſpringeth all your hope; when you ſee their flowers, thoſe you diſlike, caſt away, or elſe if you have convenience ſend them to the flower-market, the common Emtory of traſh and refuſe, and reſerve the reſt for your own delight.</p>

                     <hi>THe red Primroſe</hi> is of a newer date, more beauty, and greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety than the former; in roots leaves and faſhion it differeth not from the common ſingle field <hi>Primroſe,</hi> only the tops of the roots, and bottomes of the ſtalks, are of a reddiſh colour, but the greateſt difference is in the colours of the flowers, there being almoſt twenty diverſities of reds, ſome deeper and others lighter, from bloud red to pale Pink colour; ſome are of a blewiſh Roſe-colour, ſader and paler, ſome brick-colour, ſome Dove-colour, others of the colour of an old Buff-coat, and ſome hair-colour; all which varieties have been raiſed from ſeeds, and likewiſe theſe more excellent kinds follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fair red Primroſe</hi> is a pleaſant flower, of a moſt beautiful rich ſhining velvet red-colour, with a yellow Star in the bottome, as is in all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Scarlet Primroſe</hi> is of eſteem, the flower is of a bright Scarlet colour, more rare than any of the former.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Red Primroſe hoſe in hoſe</hi> hath upon every ſtalk (for many ſtalks bearing flowers riſe from one root, in all theſe kinds) two flowers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geminated, one ſtanding within the other, in ſome bigger and of a deeper red colour, in others leſſer and paler; of this kind I have raiſed ſix ſeveral diverſities differing from each other, either in ſize, faſhion or colour.</p>
                  <p>

flowers on one ſtalk, which towards the bottome on the upper ſide in ſome, are of a fine Orenge-colour, and the leaves liſted about the edges with Cinnamon-colour, and ſomething redder on the outſide; ſome are of a fine Scarlet colour deeper or lighter in great variety, all proceeding from the ſeeds of the deepeſt coloured flowers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The red Cowſlip hoſe in hoſe</hi> hath many flowers on one ſtalk, like thoſe of the ingeminated red <hi>Primroſe</hi> before deſcribed, but leſſer; of theſe I have five diſtinct diverſities, ſome bigger, ſome leſſer, and of deeper or lighter red colours.</p>
                  <p>Of ſome of theſe ſorts a multitude have been and are yearly raiſed from ſeeds, ſtill ſowed in hope of gaining new varieties, caſting thoſe away that do not anſwer expectation, which by many about <hi>London,</hi> with ſuch like refuſe; are ſent into the flower-market, and there ſold for little, for had they not that way to purge their Gardens, they would certainly, as I and others do, deſtroy them. I have lately heard ſeveral ignorant pretenders to the knowledge of flowers ſay, that they could buy in that market the beſt <hi>Tulips</hi> in <hi>England</hi> for five ſhillings the hundred, the beſt red <hi>Primroſes</hi> and <hi>Bears-ears</hi> for ſix pence the dozen, and all other flowers whatſoever, one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for two pence a piece; and I believe they and many others are confident that there are no better to be found in the world, than thoſe there ſold at that rate, for my part I ſhall not endeavour to undeceive them, but wiſh them good markets that are ſo poorly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and return to the ſubject in hand.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> kinds are hardy and proſper in any place that is not too hot in the ſun; the red kinds are planted, ſowed, and ordered in the ſame manner as we do the <hi>Bears-ears;</hi> yet if ſowed in a bed of good earth towards the end of <hi>September,</hi> they will come up at the Spring, and ſoon come to bear flowers; we ſhall only add ſome few varieties of another kind of ſmall <hi>Cowſlips,</hi> and then proceed to other things.</p>

                  <p>They begin to flower in <hi>April,</hi> are in the greateſt glory in <hi>May,</hi> and many continue flowering all the Sommer, and untill they are chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by Froſts.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, that have ſingle ones of the ſame kinds, are raiſed from the ſeeds thereof, the double never bearing any, neither do the ſeeds of every ſingle kind produce any double, but if you have good ſeeds and of a right kind, you may from them raiſe many double flowers, which having obtained, ſow them at the full of the Moon in <hi>April</hi> in your Flower-nurcery, not too thick by any means, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are grown four or five inches high, in ſome rainy ſeaſon, pull them up, then turn the bed over where they grew, and ſet them again in rows at convenient diſtance; after they have ſtood ſome time, and begin to grow high, take them up again as before, ſo ſet them the ſecond time, by this means they will become more hardy, grow low, and ſpread in branches, have ſtrength to endure the Winter, and at the Spring be far better Plants to remove, than thoſe that run up with long ſtalks, which ſeldom eſcape the Froſts in Winter; and you will have many with double flowers among them, which may be perceived in the buds, which will be rounder and bigger than thoſe of the ſingle, and thoſe you may remove into your Garden, taking them up carefully, not breaking the roots, and with ſome earth about them, which being a while ſhaded and watered, will grow
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50511:99"/>
and bear flowers, as well as if they had not been at all removed; thoſe with ſingle flowers muſt ſtand to bring you ſeeds, which muſt be yearly ſowed to preſerve the kinds, for after they have born flowers, commonly both the double and ſingle dye.</p>
                  <p>The other ſorts of <hi>double ſtock-Gilliflowers,</hi> do neither bear ſeeds, nor have any ſingle of the kind, ſo that they are increaſed by ſlips onely, thoſe of this kind being more apt to grow, and longer continue than the former that are raiſed from ſeeds; but as in <hi>Gilliflowers</hi> ſo it is in theſe, the firſt being more eaſily obtained, hath cauſed the later to be neglected and almoſt quite loſt, notwithſtanding one Plant of this nobler kind is worth five raiſed from ſeeds.</p>
                  <p>Many are of opinion, that double ſtocks raiſed from ſeeds, longer than the firſt year of their bearing flowers, are not to be preſerved, or kept by any way or means, but I know by experience they are miſtaken, for I have often raiſed many Plants from the ſlips or cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of this kind as well as the other; it is true that commonly the old Plant being all run up to flower, dies the next Winter, but the cuttings will grow and bear the next Spring following, almoſt as well as thoſe immediately raiſed from the ſeeds. All the art is in ſetting them, which is to be performed in manner following; Firſt make choice of ſuch branches as do not bear flowers, the which cut off ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the ſtock, ſo that they be not too long, then ſlit down the bark at the end of the ſlip about half an inch, in three or four places equally diſtant from each other, according to the bigneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which peell as far as it is ſlit and turn up, then cut off the naked woody part cloſe to the rind that is turned up, make a wide hole and ſet the ſlip therein three fingers deep, with the bark ſpread open round about the end thereof, then cover it, which being ſhaded for ſome time and watered, if the ground be any thing good, will grow and proſper very well; and certainly this is the beſt and moſt abſolute way to raiſe double ſtocks of any kind that hath been practiſed by any; and in the like manner you may cut and ſet ſlips of the beſt <hi>Wall-flowers, Gilliflowers,</hi> or of any other woody Plant that will grow of ſlips, a pretty practice for Ladies and Gentlewomen, for whoſe ſakes chiefly it is here inſerted; they may alſo be increaſed by laying the ſlips after the manner of <hi>Gilliflowers.</hi>

                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:50511:101"/>Theſe ſeeds are to be ſowed very thin, upon a bed of good freſh earth, after rain, in the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> the Plants well grown, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in ſome rainy ſeaſon, and ſet again in rows a foot aſunder, where the year following they will bear flowers, ſome double, but more ſingle, which may be pulled up and caſt away as ſoon as diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, leaving only thoſe with double flowers. Plant your beſt <hi>Gilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers</hi> in pots, which muſt be placed to bear flowers, where they may have the morning Sun only, for the after-noon Sun doth the plants much harm: water them in their neceſsity gently, to moiſten the earth by degrees, for too much wet rots the ſmall fibres, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed your pots be not over wet at the bottome, neither would theſe flowers be long wet on the leaves.</p>
                  <p>Every year ſome of them will die: ſet not another in the ſame earth, but take it out, and fill the pot again with that which is freſh, for earth in pots will ſpend it ſelf more than that in Beds, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be yearly renewed: from ſuch ſtocks as eſcape the Winter, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bearing, take as much of the earth as you can out of the pot, without hurting the roots, and fill it up again with that which is freſh; in Winter, and to the middle of <hi>April</hi> (that the weather grows hot) water in the morning, after in the evening, putting water to the roots, not wetting the branches.</p>
                  <p>When your flowers are ſpindled, bind them to ſticks, and nip off all ſuperfluous buds, that the flowers of ſuch you leave may be the fairer; ſtick hollow Kix, and the Cleies of Beaſts upon the ends of ſticks about your pots, into which Earwigs and black Inſects in the night will creep, which may be taken in the morning and deſtroyed; when the flowers begin to appear, open the points of the pods to give them liberty, and thoſe pods which break, bind with a narrow liſt, of the thin film of a Gold-beaters old mould, which wet, will ſtick together, keep the flower round, and ſcarcely be perceived; but thoſe that are not provided with this, may cut ſome of the bark from a withy ſtick, fit it to the place, and thruſt it into the pod, to hold up the drooping ſide of the flower: when they have done bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cut away the ſtalks, and in rainy ſeaſons (which often happen in Autumn) lay the pots down on the ſides, to prevent the taking of too much wet.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt care required in the preſervation of theſe Plants is in Winter, in which ſeaſon they are to be defended from great rains, ſnows, and long froſts, as alſo from the North and Eaſt winds; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you have a convenient houſe, with large dores, that they may not want air, place them therein, as ſoon as admoniſhed by the firſt froſts, giving them at all times (unleſs in the night, and in time of froſt) as much air as the houſe will afford, and if you find them dry, in open weather gently water them with water qualified with a little Sheeps dung (not wetting the leaves) eſpecially after a long froſt, which will ſettle the earth to the roots: let not your pots be too wet
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50511:102"/>
by any means, and if too dry, froſt doth them the more harm. In <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> in fair days often ſet them forth, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times let them receive a gentle ſhower, but take them in at night; in <hi>April</hi> cut away the dead leaves, fill the pots that want, with good earth, and place them where they are to ſtand to bear flowers.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that want a convenient houſe to winter theſe tender Plants, may place the pots cloſe to a South or Weſt wall, where with thin boards ſupported over them, they may be defended from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned prejudices, and by taking off the boards, aired at pleaſure; this way is by moſt <hi>Floriſts</hi> preferred before houſing, and practiſed with better ſucceſs; for <hi>Gilliflowers</hi> ſo much affect an open and free air, that if they want it, they will ſoon aſcertain the owner by his loſs, the verity of this period.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Clove Gilliflowers</hi> and others of the more ordinary kind, ſuch may be ſet on banks or beds, and increaſed as the former; the chiefeſt care required about them, is to ſhake off the ſnow, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them from exceſsive wet in Winter; you may preſerve them from long hard froſts, by putting peaſe-ſtraw rotted to duſt, two fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers thick about their roots.</p>

The colours of theſe flowers in ſeveral Plants, are either white, Silver-colour, Cream-colour, bluſh, <hi>Roſe</hi>-colour, Carnation, Scarlet, Orenge-colour, Brimſton-colour, bright red, dark blackiſh red, or purple; of all which ſeveral colours I have Plants now grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my own Garden. After the flowers are paſt, the ſeeds are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in round flat heads, for the double kinds ſeed as well as the ſingle, which are flat, and of a whitiſh brown colour.</p>
                  <p>They commonly flower late in <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> ſo that the firſt flowers muſt be preſerved for ſeeds; for although the Plants are of ſome continuance, yet they are chiefly increaſed and raiſed from ſeeds, which are to be ſowed in the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> where the ſecond year they will bear flowers, out of which the beſt may be choſen, and thoſe removed into the Garden in <hi>October</hi> after they have done bearing.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The double Colombines,</hi> for the ſingle are not regarded, are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the flowers, which chiefly are of four colours, namely white, blew, murrey purple, and red, ſome deeper, and others ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but theſe ſelf-colours are not valued, thoſe that are variegated, ſtriped, ſpotted, or powdered, are onely entertained, whereof there are many diverſities, differing in colours, or manner of marking, from each other; ſome will be half white, and half of another colour, as light blew, violet-purple, murrey, or light red; others ſtriped, ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and variouſly marked with theſe colours upon white, in ſome more and in others leſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The double Inverted Colombines,</hi> that is with the heels turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, are of ſeveral ſorts, as double and well-marked as thoſe of the former, and with the ſame colours, but not ſo plentiful in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The double Roſe-Colombines</hi> are thoſe that have no heels, but ſtand on the ſtalks like little double <hi>Roſes,</hi> but that the leaves are narrow and ſharp-pointed; of theſe there are ſome diverſities, of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned colours, diverſly ſtriped and mixed, ſome bigger and leſs double, and others leſſer but more double.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Degenerate Colombine</hi> is like the laſt, but that the outermoſt row of leaves is much larger than the reſt that are inward; the whole flower is commonly of a greeniſh purple colour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Virginian Colombine</hi> hath ſmall ſingle flowers with long heels, of a yellowiſh colour, ſhadowed with red, having deeper red ſpots in the hollow parts of the flower; this came to us in Plants from <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi> and from the ſeeds thereof, many have been raiſed, but few like the original, moſt of them degenerating into ſimple ſingle ill-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured flowers.</p>
                  <p>They flower in the end of <hi>May</hi> after the <hi>Tulips</hi> are paſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more acceptable, that ſeaſon affording few other flowers.</p>

                  <p>The two firſt flower about <hi>July,</hi> the other, if they bear the firſt year they are ſowed, it will be late in <hi>September,</hi> ſo that then from ſuch Plants little good ſeed can be expected, but the beſt way to be ſure of good ſeeds, is about the beginning of <hi>June</hi> to remove the young Plants, to keep them back from running up to flower the firſt year, which will cauſe them to bring their flowers ſooner the next, and ſo have time to ripen the ſeeds, from which being ſowed in <hi>April,</hi> many more varieties may be raiſed than are before deſcribed, eſpecially from the flowers that are of the lighteſt and moſt mixed colours, the which are chiefly to be reſerved for that purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>There is another, little differing from this, but that the flowers are of a light purple colour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The leſſer Thorn-Aple</hi> differeth from the former, in that it is lower and much leſſer in all the parts thereof; the leaves are ſmooth and rent at the edges, and the ſtalks without branches; the flowers come forth at the joynts like the other, not ſo big, but more beautiful, white in colour, and like a Bell in faſhion; the Aples or heads that contain the ſeeds are leſſer, rounder and harder than thoſe of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kind; the root dies at the firſt appearance of Winter.</p>
                  <p>We talk much of two other varieties of this leſſer kind, the one bearing flowers ingeminated, or <hi>hoſe in hoſe,</hi> one coming out of the other; and another that is double, conſiſting of two or more rows of leaves riſing equally together; I have ſeen the figures of both theſe well cut in Braſs, in two or three Books of Flowers Printed in Forein Countries, and it is like that ſuch there are in thoſe parts, but I am confident they were never ſeen in <hi>England,</hi> otherwiſe than in picture.</p>
                  <p>For that with ſingle flowers will hardly flower with us, and if it do, it is ſo late that it ſeldom yieldeth any good ſeeds; the greater kind is common and will grow any where, the fitteſt place is in an Orchard or Kitchen-Garden, for it takes more room than the Plant deſerves.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Cquaints you with the fineſt Garden-fruits, Vines &amp; Berries, our Engliſh Nurceries do afford; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with ſome Flower-bearing Trees, Shrubs, and Greens, more familliar than thoſe you find in the firſt book; with the order that is to be uſed in their Propagation, Planting and Improvement.</p>
               <p>Good Gardens are to be furniſhed with rare Fruits, as well as fine Flowers; and although moſt perſons of ability at the firſt, plant their walls with Trees bought out of the Nurceries about <hi>London,</hi> yet it will be neceſſary for ſuch (as well as others) to have a Quarter in the Nurcery, ſet with choice Stocks of every kind, for the raiſing of young Trees, that if any of the firſt proviſion either die, or fail to bear ſuch Fruits as are deſired, their places, out of their own ſtore, may be ſupplied with better; beſides, it is no ſmall ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to a Planter, to be aſſured what Fruits his Trees will bear: therefore before I proceed to the particulars, to prevent repetition, the following Rules neceſſarily require to be inſerted, and firſt,</p>
               <p>For the raiſing of Stocks for <hi>Garden-Fruits,</hi> the which are to be of four different kinds, as <hi>Apples, Quinces, Plums,</hi> and <hi>Cherries;</hi> for <hi>Apples</hi> that you may have dwarf-trees fit for Walls, the ſtocks you muſt provide are thoſe of the <hi>Paradiſe Apple,</hi> either raiſed from the Kernels, or from Layers, the branches being as apt to root as thoſe of <hi>Codlings,</hi> in which you may graft what other good <hi>Apples</hi> you deſire; but in reſpect theſe ſtocks (of their own nature) grow ſlowly, I have found out another expedient to help them forward, that is, by grafting the <hi>Cyen</hi> of the <hi>Paradiſe Apple</hi> in a <hi>Crab,</hi> or other <hi>Apple-ſtock,</hi> cloſe to the ground, with one graft, and when that is grown to the bigneſs of a finger, graft thereon about eight inches higher, the fruit deſired, which will ſtop the luxurious growth of the tree, almoſt
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50511:119"/>
as well as if it had been immediately grafted on the forementioned Layers, and will cauſe the Trees to bear ſooner, more, and better fruits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quince-ſtocks</hi> are eaſily raiſed, either by Cuttings, or Suckers, of which you may have great ſtore from one old Tree, by cutting it down in <hi>March,</hi> within two inches of the ground, which will cauſe a multitude of Suckers to riſe from the root; when they are grown half a yard high, cover them at the bottom a foot thick, with good earth, which in dry times muſt be watered, and as ſoon as they have put forth roots, in Winter remove them into your Nurcery, where, in a year or two, they will be ready to graft with <hi>Pears</hi> for your walls. Theſe Stocks (as thoſe of the <hi>Paradiſe Apple</hi>) will cauſe the Trees to dwarf, and not to riſe ſo high, but that they may be conveniently ſpread upon walls, which grafted on <hi>Pear-ſtocks,</hi> would grow too big and ſturdy; beſides the <hi>Quince-ſtocks</hi> cauſe the <hi>Pears</hi> grafted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be fairer, much better coloured, and the trees to bear ſooner and more ſtore of fruits. There are ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Quinces,</hi> but the beſt and fitteſt for this purpoſe is that of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plum-ſtocks</hi> are raiſed from Suckers and Stones, choice being made of the kinds; thoſe of the <hi>white Pear-plum</hi> are eſteemed the beſt, but indeed, thoſe of any other great <hi>white,</hi> or <hi>red Plum,</hi> that hath large leaves, and ſhoots, are as good, either to graft other choice <hi>Plums</hi> upon, or for the budding of <hi>Apricocks</hi> and <hi>Peaches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cherry-ſtocks</hi> are alſo raiſed from Suckers and Stones; thoſe of the ordinary wild <hi>black Cherry</hi> are moſt commonly uſed to this purpoſe, but Stocks of a better and more agreeable nature may be raiſed from the ſtones of the <hi>black Heart-Cherry, Duke, Luke ward, Amber,</hi> and <hi>Morello Cherries:</hi> the Stocks of our common <hi>Engliſh red Cherries</hi> are moſt uſed for the grafting of <hi>May</hi> or <hi>early Cherries;</hi> the <hi>Morello,</hi> and indeed any other ſort will form trees more fit for walls of eight or nine foot high, than the <hi>black Cherry ſtocks,</hi> which cauſe the trees to grow much taller,</p>
               <p>The Stones of <hi>Apricocks</hi> and <hi>Peaches</hi> are not worth the ſetting for ſtocks to inoculate with other good kinds, in reſpect their roots are ſpongy, and will neither laſt nor endure to be tranſplanted: therefore the Stones of <hi>Plums</hi> and <hi>Cherries</hi> are chiefly for that purpoſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and diſpoſed after the ways following.</p>
               <p>Having provided a good collection of the Stones of <hi>Plums</hi> and <hi>Cherries,</hi> in <hi>October</hi> prick them down in rows, the ſharp end upwards, about three fingers deep, in a bed of good earth, well turned up and raked; then cover the ſame all over with new long dung, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the froſts, which in <hi>April</hi> you may take off, and in <hi>May</hi> they will come up, and being kept from weeds, in two years will be ready to remove into your Nurcery, in rich and well manured ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepared for that purpoſe: before you ſet them, cut off ſuch
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50511:119"/>
roots as run down, as alſo the tops and ſide branches, placing them in rows, at four foot diſtance, each kind apart, where in a year or two moſt of them will be ready to graft in the bud, the <hi>Plums,</hi> with the beſt of their own kind, and alſo with <hi>Apricocks</hi> and <hi>Peaches;</hi> the <hi>Cherries</hi> are only fit to be budded with other good ſorts of <hi>Cherries;</hi> as for Suckers, they muſt be ſet in the Nurcery after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and after they are grown to an inch Diameter, may convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be grafted in the cleft.</p>
               <p>Gather your Grafts of <hi>Plums, Cherries,</hi> and <hi>Pears,</hi> from the middle of <hi>January,</hi> to the ſame time in <hi>February,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Apples</hi> may ſtay untill <hi>March:</hi> chooſe ſuch as are of two ſaps, that the old wood to the knot may be placed in the ſtock; thoſe of one years ſhoot will ſerve in default of the other, but ſuch will be longer before they come to bear.</p>
               <p>Make choice of ſuch Grafts as are ſtrongeſt, and take them from ſuch branches as are apteſt to bear, and then fulleſt of Fruit-buds; ſuch Trees as are ill bearers, or not come to bear fruit, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, the Grafts always partaking the quality of the Tree from whence they are taken: Bind your Grafts in bundles, each ſort by it ſelf, and put them half way to the tops in earth, untill you uſe them, keeping an exact account of the kinds, that you be not miſtaken in your fruits; as for the ſeveral ways of grafting them, it is to be performed with much exactneſs, in manner following.</p>
               <p>Grafting (as we are taught by common experience) is the artificial placing the <hi>Cyen,</hi> or Graft of one kind, upon the ſtock of another, ſo as the ſap of the Stock may without impediment come to nouriſh the Graft; it is therefore expedient in this operation (the Saps paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing betwixt the bark and the wood) that they be exactly joyned, which is effected four ſeveral ways.</p>
               <p>The firſt and moſt known is grafting in the Cleft, <hi>Plums</hi> and <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> about the new Moon in <hi>February, Pears</hi> in the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>Apples</hi> a fortnight or three weeks after: Firſt, ſaw off the head of the ſtock, in a ſmooth place, for Wall-trees, within four fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the ground, in Standards much higher, according to the growth of the ſtock; pare away with your knife the roughneſs the ſaw hath left, then cleave the head a little beſides the pith, and put therein a long wedge of hard wood to keep the cleft open, which cut ſmooth with the point of your knife, that the ſides may be eaven, then cut the Graft on both ſides from a knot or bud, in form of a wedge, in length proportionable to the cleft, with ſhoulderings, which place therein, ſo as the Saps may exactly joyn. Laſtly, cover the Head with clay well tempered with Horſe-dung, and leave not the Grafts too long.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way is called Shoulder, or Whip-grafting, fit only for ſmall ſtocks, and to be performed ſomething later than the former;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50511:120"/>
firſt cut off the Head of the ſtock, and ſmooth it as in Cleft grafting, then cut the Graft from a knot or bud on one ſide ſloping, about an inch and half long, with a Shouldering, that it may reſt on the Head of the ſtock; the Graft muſt be cut from the Shouldering ſmooth and eaven, ſloping by degrees, that the lower end may be left thin; place the Shouldering of the Graft upon the Head of the ſtock, and with your knife cut away ſo much of the bark, as the cut ſide of the Graft did cover, place both together, that their Saps may exactly joyn, then bind them together with ruſhes, flags, or baſte, and clay the Head as in the former.</p>
               <p>The third way is called grafting by Approach, by ſome Ablactation; and this is done in <hi>April,</hi> ſooner or later, according to the ſtate of the Spring; the manner differs from the laſt, in that the <hi>Cyen</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains on its own ſtock, and the Head alſo on the ſtock you would graft, therefore both muſt be planted together, or in Caſes, that they may be ſo poſited; the Branches of both (being near of one ſize) muſt be brought together, that they may touch each other the length of three inches, then cut the joyning ſides of both untill you approach near the pith, and fit them ſo together, that the Saps may exactly meet, in which poſition bind them, and cover the place with ſuch tempered clay as is uſed in Heading of Grafts: as ſoon as you perceive the <hi>Cyen</hi> and ſtock to be well cimented and incorporated, cut off the Head of the ſtock four inches above the binding, and in <hi>March</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtub you left above, as alſo the <hi>Cyen</hi> underneath, cloſe to the grafted place, that it may ſubſiſt by the Stock only: ſome uſe to cut off the Head of the Stock at firſt, then joyn the <hi>Cyen</hi> thereunto, after the manner of Shoulder-grafting, differing only in not ſevering the <hi>Cyen</hi> from its own Stock; both ways are good, but I have found the firſt the more ſuccesful. This manner of Grafting is chiefly uſed, in ſuch nice and tender Plants, as are not apt to take any other way, as <hi>Orenges, Limons, Pomgranats, Vines, Geſſamins, Althea frutex,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>The fourth and moſt conſiderable way of Grafting of all other, is called <hi>Inoculating</hi> or <hi>Budding,</hi> the which is effected by taking off the Eye or ſmall bud which grows betwixt the leaf and the new ſhoot or Lance, and ſo placing it on a fit ſtock, that it may from thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nutrition agreeable: and this may ſeaſonably be done, from Midſomer, to the middle of <hi>July,</hi> at ſuch time as the Sap is moſt in the ſtock, and the bark eaſieſt to be raiſed: the Buds muſt not be too young or tender, but taken from ſtrong well-grown Shoots of the ſame year, which being cut from the Tree, take away the top and leaves, leaving half their ſtalks, by which you may hold the Buds when you put them into the ſtocks; then having made choice of ſtocks, according to the nature of your Buds, in a ſmooth place make a croſs cut thorough the bark of the ſtock, then from the middle thereof, gently ſlit the bark thorough, (not wounding the ſtock) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an inch long, then nimbly prepare the Bud, by cutting the bark on both ſides the length of the ſlit, as much above as below, forming a
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50511:120"/>
Shield or Eſcocheon, with the lower end a little ſharp; next take off the Bark on the other ſide, and with a quill, cut in the faſhion of a ſcoop an inch long, take off the Bark and bud dexterouſly, that you leave not the root behind, for if you ſee a hole under the bud on the inſide, caſt it away and prepare another; the Shield being thus made ready, hold it in your mouth by the end of the ſtalk, untill with the flat end of your knife you have raiſed the Bark of the ſtock on either ſide the ſlit, ſufficient to receive the Sheild, which put in with care between the Bark and wood; thruſting it down untill the top joyn to the croſs cut, then bind it cloſe with Baſt taken out of a <hi>Ruſſia Mat,</hi> or Woollen yarn, ſo that the bud may ſit cloſe to the ſtock; there is another way more ready than this, which I have long uſed with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, it differs onely from the former, in that from the croſs cut, the Bark is ſlit upwards, and the Shield formed, and put in accordingly, leaving the end below the bud, longer then may ſerve, and after it is thruſt up as high as is neceſſary, cut off what is ſuperfluous, at the croſs cut, with which the end muſt joyn, than bind it as the former. There are other ways of <hi>Inoculating,</hi> but theſe two are the beſt, and the later the more expedite and eaſie to be performed.</p>
               <p>The beſt time to <hi>Inoculate</hi> is in the evening of a fair day, in a dry ſeaſon, for rain falling on the buds before they have taken, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy moſt of them; after three weeks you may cut away the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in <hi>March</hi> following the head of the ſtock, three fingers above the bud, which being well grown, cut cloſe, that the ſtock may cover.</p>
               <p>In placing of grafts or buds in ſtocks, you muſt conſider what Trees you intend them for, either ſtandards, or for walls, and ſo graft or bud them high or low accordingly; as alſo to lodge them on that ſide of the ſtock which is moſt expoſed to the ſtrongeſt winds, to prevent their being blown out or looſened.</p>
               <p>When your Grafts are grown half a yard high, thoſe you find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſhoot up in one lance, pinch off their tender tops, which will prevent their mounting, and cauſe them to put forth ſide-bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; in <hi>March</hi> following, prune away thoſe are ſmall, and what you find ſuperfluous, cutting the long lances cloſe behind a bud, a thing always to be obſerved in pruning.</p>
               <p>If the ground of your Nurcery be good, and kept from Weeds by often turning, moſt of theſe Grafts (eſpecially the ſtone-fruits) will be ready to tranſplant within a year or two, but <hi>Pears</hi> and <hi>Apples</hi> grafted on the forementioned ſtocks, to form Dwarf, or wall-Trees, growing ſlowly, require more time, and not to be removed untill the ſtocks are covered.</p>
               <p>The beſt time to tranſplant and ſet Trees, is about the middle of <hi>October,</hi> which muſt be carefully taken up, that the roots be not cut or broken, but before they are ſet, you muſt cut off ſuch roots as
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50511:121"/>
run down, and the ends of thoſe you find too long, as alſo moſt of the ſmall threds where they grow too thick. Which done, the ground and place where they are to be planted being prepared, and wide holes opened, raiſe a ſmall hill in the centre thereof, whereon ſet your tree, opening and ſpreading the roots round about it; then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them with the beſt earth, and ſhake the tree that the roots lie not hollow, treading it down to faſten them.</p>
               <p>Standards all know are to be ſet upright, but if naturally they lean any way, let it be towards South-Weſt, from whence the ſtrongeſt winds commonly proceed; theſe muſt be ſupported with ſtrong ſtakes, that they be not toſſed, but kept upright: wall-trees are to be placed at ſuch diſtance, as they may be leaned to the wall, and moſt conveniently ſpread and nailed thereunto.</p>
               <p>The beſt time to plaſh, prune, and nail trees, is in <hi>February,</hi> after the great Froſts are paſt, except <hi>Peaches</hi> and <hi>Nectorins,</hi> which being cut before the riſing of the ſap, are apt to dye after the knife, and ſo ſtump and deform the Tree, therefore ſuch muſt be left untill they begin to put forth buds and bloſſoms. Spread the boughs and branches upon the wall, like the ribbs of a Screen fan, or the fingers of your hand diſplayed, and let not one croſs the other, leaving no place bare; ſuch as will not come handſomely to the wall, muſt be cut off cloſe to the ſtock, and the ends of the ſmall branches, cloſe behind a leaf bud; and in Sommer when they put forth new wood, rub off ſuch buds, as growing may deform the Tree; after <hi>Midſomer</hi> you muſt give your Trees a ſecond pruning, by cutting away the new lances, to give Sun and Air to the fruits, to cauſe them to ripen, and be well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louted. The pruning of Trees dependeth much on the diſcretion of the Operator, who is to conſider the growth of every Tree, and what may moſt conveniently be taken away, without leaving the walls too bare. The well and ſeaſonable pruning of Trees in Sommer, will cauſe them to ſet thick with Fruit-buds, and bear plentifully; and if too many, cut off the ſmalleſt, leaving ſo many as the Tree may be well able to nouriſh and bring to perfection.</p>
               <p>There are many other obſervations about fruit Trees, but theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted are the moſt eſſential, which together with what you will find at the end of every Chapter, where each particular is deſcribed, may be ſufficient to inform all ſuch as deſire to be Planters, beſides their own practice will every year inform them, Experience being the beſt Tutor.</p>

                  <hi>THe Apricock,</hi> eſpecially the common ſort, is known unto all, but we have ſeveral better kinds wherewith it concerns every ingenious Planter to be acquainted, and therefore to be deſcribed: we will paſs by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort, and begin with the firſt ripe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Algier Apricock</hi> is leſſer in all the parts than the common kind; the fruit is ſmall, round and yellow, ripe a moneth or more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other kinds; the tree is tender, and impatient of long froſts, from which (in the more Northerly ſcituation) it requires with Mats to be defended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Maſculine Apricock</hi> hath thinner and ſmoother leaves than thoſe of the common kind, the fruit larger, better, and ſooner ripe, but if the Tree be not well ordered, unapt to bear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The long Apricock</hi> differeth chiefly from the laſt, in that the fruit is longer, and of a paler yellow colour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The white Apricock</hi> hath the leaves folded, ſeldome opening; the fruit is leſſer, whiter, and better than that of the common kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Orenge Apricock</hi> is ſomething like the ordinary ſort, only the fruit is fairer, rounder and better, of a deep yellow colour, and good taſte.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Great Roman Apricock</hi> is bigger in all the parts than any of the former, the fruit alſo bigger than that of any other kind, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to preſerve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apricocks</hi> are eaſily raiſed, being apt to take, inoculated on a <hi>Plum</hi> ſtock; thoſe that have the largeſt Shoots, leaves, and Fruits, are fitteſt for this purpoſe, as alſo for budding of <hi>Peaches,</hi> and for graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other good ſorts of <hi>Plums; Apricocks</hi> require to be planted on a South wall, and to be often pruned, being apt to grow in wood, and therefore the Midſomer Pruning, as well as the Winters, is not to be neglected.</p>

                  <hi>The green Nectorine,</hi> of which there is a bigger and a leſſer, the later not worth the Planting, the other is bigger, always green on the outſide, of a firm and ſomething hard ſubſtance, and raw taſte, unleſs fully ripe.</p>

                  <hi>The white Nectorine</hi> is as big as the greater yellow, white on the outſide, and a little red towards the Sun, no better taſted than the yellow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Paper-white Nectorine</hi> is ſomething leſſer than the former, but more beautiful, and better taſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The painted Nectorine</hi> is as big as the firſt white, full of red ſpots, and of a good taſte.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The red Roman Nectorine</hi> hath the fruit fairer and better taſted than moſt of the former, of a fine red colour on the outſide, and near the ſtone, of a Musky ſweet ſcent, and delicate taſte.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The red Nectorine</hi> that comes clean from the ſtone, is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fruit, like the former, but, for that it leaves the ſtone, more eſteemed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Murrey Nectorine</hi> is bigger and rounder than the laſt, of a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh colour, ſhadowed over with dark murry purple, firm, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hard, not ſo good as the <hi>Roman.</hi>

                  <hi>The Tawny Nectorine</hi> is as red as the laſt on the outſide, firm, and yellow within, an excellent fruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Ruſſet Nectorine</hi> is a good fruit, of a brown or ruſſet-colour on the outſide, and red at the ſtone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Orbine Nectorine</hi> is ſomething like the laſt, but redder on the outer ſide, and well taſted.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Peaches</hi> and <hi>Nectorines</hi> are raiſed by <hi>Inoculating</hi> the Buds in good <hi>Plum</hi>-ſtocks, ſet in rich ground, that they may abound in Sap; for if the Stocks be weak and dry, the Buds will not hold. The beſt <hi>Necto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi> are to be <hi>Inoculated</hi> into an <hi>Apricock,</hi> and ſo are the beſt <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> eſpecially the Early kinds, for which purpoſe you muſt provide <hi>Apricocks</hi> of the common kind, budded as low as you can, that after one year they may be <hi>Inoculated</hi> again a foot higher with the beſt <hi>Peaches,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Nectorines.</hi> Theſe fruits are alſo raiſed from Stones ſet in <hi>October,</hi> but many kinds are apt to degenerate; beſides, the Trees are not only impatient of removal, but of leſs continuance, and worſe bearers than thoſe budded on the forementioned Stocks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peaches</hi> and <hi>Nectorines</hi> are more tender than <hi>Apricocks,</hi> and the fruits require more Sun to ripen them, therefore they muſt be Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the hotteſt wall, and that which hath the Sun longeſt upon it: they muſt not be pruned in Winter, the wood being apt then to die after the knife; the beſt time is when they begin to flower, and then cut away what is dead, and ſuch Lances as are too long, behind a Leaf-bud, and nail them cloſe to the wall.</p>
               <p>If you let the middle ſtem grow upright, the ſide-branches will not proſper, but decay for want of nouriſhment, the top drawing away the Sap; to prevent which, whilſt the Tree is young, bow down the head toward the Sun, and ſo nail it to the wall, which will ſtop the Sap, and cauſe the Tree to put forth ſide-branches, and to bear plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully. Such Trees as are old and decaying, cut them down in <hi>March</hi> as low as you can with convenience, leaving ſome branches to draw the Sap, and cover the wound with Clay: the Stock will put forth new Lances, and in a year or two come to bear fruit again.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The white Filbeard</hi> differs from the common <hi>Haſel nut,</hi> in that the Husks are longer, the Nuts thinner ſhelled, and the Kernels of a better taſte.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The red Filbeard</hi> differs from the white in the Husks and Nuts, which are browner, and the Kernels covered all over with a red skin, of a more delicate taſte than the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Filbeard of Conſtantinople</hi> hath the Bark whiter, the Leaves
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50511:129"/>
bigger, and the Husks more jagged and rent than the former, the Nuts are like thoſe of the <hi>white Filbeard,</hi> but rounder and bigger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The great round Nut</hi> hath ſhorter Husks than the <hi>Filbeards,</hi> the <hi>Nuts</hi> bigger than any two of them, ſhort and round, with great heads, the crowns in ſome being as broad as a Groat, the Shell is thick and hard, and the Kernels much bigger than other <hi>Nuts</hi> are, ſhells and all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The great long Soft-ſhelled Nut</hi> differs from the laſt, in that the <hi>Nuts</hi> are long, larger, and ſomething flat, the Shells as ſoft as any of the <hi>Filbeards,</hi> the Kernel as big as an <hi>Almond,</hi> and very well taſted.</p>
               <p>I confeſs theſe <hi>Nuts</hi> are more proper for an Orchard than a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but in reſpect they fitly ſerve to be Planted and ſpread upon the North wall of the Fruit-Gardens, I have ſet them down in this place.</p>
               <p>They are all aptly raiſed from Suckers, or by Grafting, as I have found by experience, having many goodly Trees of the <hi>Filbeard</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the great <hi>Nut,</hi> which I grafted upon ordinary <hi>Hazle</hi> ſtocks; theſe <hi>Nuts</hi> ſpread upon a North wall, do not onely cover it with fair green leaves, but will bear <hi>Nuts</hi> abundantly; they muſt not be ſet too thick, becauſe the branches will ſpread far and wide, which muſt be bowed down, nayled to the wall, and often ſheared in Somer, which will cauſe the Trees to thicken, and bear more and bigger <hi>Nuts,</hi> than if they grew at large.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The red Muſcadine Grape</hi> is as large as the White, but not ſo apt to ripen with us, requiring more Sun.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Raiſin of the Sun Grape</hi> is large, red and good, and in the Southern parts ripens reaſonable well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Burſarobe</hi> is an excellent large, ſweet, white <hi>Grape,</hi> of much eſteem in <hi>France,</hi> and in ſome years will be ripe with us.</p>

                  <hi>The Frontiniack</hi> is a white Musky ſweet <hi>Grape,</hi> but ſeldome comes to perfection.</p>

                  <hi>The Muſcat Grapes</hi> are moſt eſteemed in <hi>France,</hi> as the <hi>Chaſſeluts, Bicane,</hi> and <hi>Rochel;</hi> the <hi>Grapes</hi> are ſweet and good, great bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and doubtleſs in a skilful hand, and good place, will do well with us.</p>

                  <hi>The Burlet</hi> is the largeſt <hi>Grape</hi> we have, and though the <hi>Grapes</hi> be ſour, as not ripening with us, yet the great bunches, and large white <hi>Grapes,</hi> make a gallant ſhew on a Wall, and will make very good Vinegar.</p>
               <p>There are more than a hundred ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Grapes,</hi> but theſe mentioned are fitteſt for our Climate; the moſt agreeable are the three firſt. All <hi>Vines</hi> are aptly encreaſed by Layers or Cuttings, and if the earth be good, will quickly ſtrike roots.</p>
               <p>They are to be Planted on South walls, and confined by cutting; the cloſer they are pruned, the better they will bear, and the fairer will be the <hi>Grapes:</hi> make the ground you ſet them in, with rich light ſandy earth, and every Winter open the Roots, and mend the ſoil with old dung; cut them at a knot in <hi>January</hi> to prevent bleeding, and about Midſomer take away the ſuperfluous branches, and ſtop the Lances before the Flowers, and when the <hi>Grapes</hi> begin to ſwell, take the leaves from about them, that they may have the full bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Sun.</p>

                  <hi>The black Mulberry</hi> groweth to a large ſcramb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Tree, ſpreading wide, but not very tall, apt to be bowed into any form; the leaves are round, thick and pointed, nicked about the edges; the flowers are downy Catlins, which turn into Berries, at firſt green, after red, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly black, like unto Hedge Black-berries, but bigger and longer, ſomething ſweet in taſte.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort of <hi>black Mulberry,</hi> more rare; it chiefly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in the Berries, which are much bigger and better taſted than thoſe of the former common kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The white Mulberry</hi> groweth leſſer ſpread than the black, the leaves paler, ſofter, and thinner ſet on the branches, the Berries ſmaller, the grains thicker ſet, white and ſweet in taſte.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Virginian Mulberry</hi> ſoon groweth with us to a fair Tree, with larger leaves than the laſt; the Berries are longer and redder than any of the former, and of a pleaſant taſte.</p>
               <p>Theſe Trees are eaſily raiſed either by Suckers, Layers or Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; and the great <hi>black Mulberry</hi> may be grafted on the common kind.</p>

                     <hi>The white Holland Goosberry</hi> is the faireſt, biggeſt, and beſt bearer of all others; the Berries are large, round, ſmooth, white, tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and well-taſted.</p>

                  <hi>The great red Curran</hi> is a plentiful bearer, the Berries twice as big as thoſe of the former, of a bright ſhining red colour, and good (though ſomething ſharp) taſte.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The greateſt dark red Dutch Curran</hi> differs from the laſt, in that the Berries are bigger, of a more blackiſh colour, and ſweeter taſte.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The white Curran</hi> is like the great red, onely the Berries are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſer, white, tranſparent, and well-taſted.</p>
               <p>They are as eaſily increaſed as <hi>Goosberries</hi> by Suckers, parting the roots or laying the branches; theſe may be budded one upon another, and ſo ſeveral ſorts grow from one Stock, as is ſaid of the <hi>Goosberries.</hi>

                     <hi>THe Tree of Life</hi> by long ſtanding groweth as big as a Mans leg, with many branches hanging downwards, and ſet with winged leaves, ſomething like thoſe of <hi>Savin,</hi> but flatter, and platted like a Lace, of a fair green colour in Somer, but dark and brown in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of a ſtrong reſinous ſcent, to ſome not unpleaſant; in <hi>May,</hi> on the tops of the branches are many ſmall downy yellowiſh flowers, ſtanding in ſmall ſcaly heads, wherein lie ſmall long browniſh ſeeds, which in ſome places ripen with us, and being ſowed ſpring and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper reaſonably well, but the Plant is ſo apt to root in Layers, that the Seeds are ſeldom ſowen.</p>

I have ſeen a ſort of this ordinary <hi>Bay,</hi> that in reſpect of the ſmooth ſhining green leaves, and thoſe thicker ſet on the branches, carried the face of a noble Plant, and certainly was a choice variety raiſed from Seeds. Theſe <hi>Bays</hi> are not to be ſet too much in the Sun, nor open to the North or Eaſt winds; their Roots muſt be defended from long hard Froſts, by covering them with ſtore of long Dung, which at the Spring may be removed: they are commonly increaſed by Suckers, and ſome ſow the Berries, which will come up and proſper reaſonably well, if defended in Winter. And as I begun the firſt Book with a forward <hi>Bay</hi> bearing <hi>Cherries,</hi> I will now conclude this laſt with our domeſtick <hi>Bay</hi> bearing Berries.</p>
